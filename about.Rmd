On occasions she has been known to masquerade as a [statistician](https://learningstatisticswithr.com), [data scientist](https://slides.djnavarro.net), [software developer](https://github.com/djnavarro) and [generative artist](https://art.djnavarro.net). She is prone to describing herself in the third person in biographies, but is willing to admit that itâ€™s super weird.
