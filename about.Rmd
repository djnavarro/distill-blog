She currently works as a Developer Relations Engineer at [Voltron Data](https://voltrondata.com/), helping other data scientists use Apache Arrow to accelerate their data analysis pipelines. In a previous life she was an academic, working as a computational cognitive scientist at [UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). Danielle is a cofounder of [R-Ladies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org), and in her better moments she [makes art from code](https://art.djnavarro.net). She is prone to describing herself in the third person in biographies, but is willing to admit that itâ€™s super weird.
