TODO: 

Insert the point from conversation with Jon. The code the read_* functions is
complicated. It handles everything for you because "reading the data" is a 
constrained task. That means the developers can optimise almost everything. 

In contrast, the code underpinning schema() etc is simple. It takes care of 
choices for you when those choices are "obvious", but it leaves all the edge
cases for you to deal with. There are a lot of weird edge cases because 
"translating between languages" is underdetermined and can only ever be 
approximate. The developers can help make it easier, but the user has to be
the final arbiter, and it helps to understand what each language is "doing". 

-->

Consider this piece of magic


```{r}
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(arrow)

magicians <- read_csv_arrow("magicians.csv")
magicians

arrowmagicks <- arrow_table(magicians)
arrowmagicks
```

The `magicians` data set is a "data frame" (a tibble, technically) stored in R. The `arrowmagicks` data set, however, is a pointer to a data structure stored in Arrow. That data structure is a "Table" object. Arrow Tables are roughly analogous to data frames -- both represent tabular data with columns that may be of different types -- but they are not the same. An act of *translation* has occurred. Similarly when we look at the individual columns we see that something similar has happened. "Integer" columns in R are mapped to "int32" columns in Arrow, "Date" columns in R become "date32" columns in Arrow, and so on. Even without knowing much about the data types in the two languages, you can infer a lot from the names! In this case you can reasonably (and correctly) infer that the translation from R to Arrow is a sensible one. Better yet, in this case, when we pull the `arrowmagicks` data back into R we recover the original data:

```{r}
collect(arrowmagicks)
```

In this example the translation back and forth "just works". You really don't have to think too much about the subtle differences in how Arrow and R "think about the world" and how their data structures are organised. And in general that's what we *want* in a multi-language toolbox: we want the data analyst to be thinking about the data, not the cross-linguistic subtleties of the data structures! 

## Defining schemas

That being said, it's also valuable to give the data analyst flexibility. The **arrow** package makes very sensible default choices about how to translate an R data structure into an Arrow data structure, but those choices can never be more than defaults because of the fundamental fact that the languages are inherently different. The quote about the [indeterminacy of translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminacy_of_translation) at the top of this post was originally written about natural languages, but I think it applies in programming too. There's no "single" rulebook that tells you how to translate between R and Arrow: there can't be. 

Suppose that I knew that there would in fact be a "Season 5.1648" coming, consisting of a single episode whose title corresponded to the full text of the [Treaty of Westphalia](https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2008/MVZ430/um/Treaty-of-Westphalia.pdf). Knowing that this new data point is coming, I'd perhaps want my Arrow data to encode `season` as a numeric variable, and I'd probably want to recognise that the text in the `title` field can be quite long. To do that I can specify an explicit *schema* that tells the **arrow** package how to translate my R data set into Arrow. I can do this with the `schema()` function:

```{r}
translation <- schema(
  season = float64(), # not the default
  episode = int32(),
  title = large_utf8(), # not the default
  air_date = date32(),
  rating = float64(),
  viewers = float64()
)
```

Now I can use my schema to govern the translation:

```{r}
arrowmagicks2 <- arrow_table(magicians, schema = translation)
arrowmagicks2
```

This is of course a very silly example. But the underlying issue is fairly serious. 

## Why mapping languages is hard

Blah blah I used to teach categorisation and mental representation. Organising the world into concepts (or data structures) is hard. We define ontologies that impose order on a chaotic world. A famous attempt to do this in 1668 by John Wilkins in [An Essay Towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/_/BCCtZjBtiEYC?hl=en&gbpv=1). A small snippet taken from the section "On Beasts":

> BEASTS, may be distinguished by their several shapes, properties, uses, food, their tameness or wildness, etc. into such as are either
> 
> - VIVIPAROUS; producing living young.
>

>             - DOG-KIND; whose *heads* are *more oblong*. V.
>             
> - OVIPAROUS; breeding *Eggs*. VI.

It goes on to elaborate. As a scientific taxonomy it's... interesting. But even psychologically it betrays the peculiarities of the author. Wilkins had the noble ambition of defining a "universal language", but as a 17th century English gentleman there are certain deficiencies! I note as an Australian that there's no distinction between placental and marsupial mammals here! But of course the problems are more general. In 1952 the Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges published an essay called [The Analytical Language of John Wilkins](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/155/assignment/ex1/Borges.pdf) and describes a classification system from an fictitious "Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge":

> In its remote pages it is written that the animals are divided into: (a) belonging to the emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) sucking pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present classification, (i) frenzied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, (l) et cetera, (m) having just broken the water pitcher, (n) that from a long way off look like flies

It's pretty unlikely that any human language would produce a classification system quite as chaotic as Borges' fictional example, but the point is well made. Actual classification systems used in different languages and cultures are very different to one another and often feel very alien when translated. Michel Foucault actually refers to this Borges passage in the preface to his famous work [The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Order_of_Things) on how different cultures and historical periods viewed the world from fundamentally different perspectives. According to Foucault, Borges essay 

> shattered ... all the familiar landmarks of thought --- our thought, the thought that bears the stamp of our age and our geography --- breaking up all the ordered surfaces and all the planes with which we are accustomed to tame the wild profusion of existing things



## Translating data types

So how do we construct data structures in Arrow that are appropriate translations of data structures in R, and vice versa? For the moment, let's keep things simple and assume that the mapping we're interested in has the same format as the one described at the start of the post: in R we want to encode the data as a data frame, and in Arrow we want to encode it as a Table. If so, the translation question is really a matter of how we encode the columns.

In the rest of this post I'll use a lot of diagrams showing the default mappings that the **arrow** package uses when converting data columns from R to Arrow and vice versa. In each case I'll show R data types on the left hand side (against a blue background) and Arrow data types on the right hand side (against an orange background), as shown below:

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Illustration of the graphical convention used in the later   diagrams, showing R on the left side (against a blue background) and Arrow on the right side (against an orange background)."

knitr::include_graphics("img/visual-convention.png", dpi = 100)
```

<aside><br>Instead of using alt-text, I've included verbose and descriptive figure captions that verbally describe the content of each diagram</aside>

## Logical types

<!-- 
TODO: add discussion of two-valued and three-valued logics here
-->

I'll start with the simplest possible case: a data frame with one column of logical data. Logical data in R can take on three possible values: `TRUE` and `FALSE` are the two allowed truth values, and `NA` is used to denote missing data. 

```{r}
df <- tibble(values = c(TRUE, FALSE, NA))
df
```

Arrow has an analogous "boolean" type, which has truth values `true` and `false`. Just like R, missing values are allowed, and are represented as `null`. Arrow booleans and R logicals are essentially equivalent to one another, so by default the **arrow** package will map an R logical to an Arrow boolean and vice versa.

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Default mappings for logical types"

knitr::include_graphics("img/logical-types.png", dpi = 100)
```

So let's do it:

```{r}
tb <- arrow_table(df)
tb
```

It's mildly annoying this doesn't print out the actual values. Happily the **arrow** package supplies a `$` operator for Arrow Table objects so we can do this:

```{r}
tb$values
```

Okay, that makes sense. The "ChunkedArray" bit might seem a little unfamiliar to R users -- and I'll come back to it later -- but for now we can imagine it's something similar to an R vector. 

This also tells us a little more about the relationship between R data frames and Arrow Tables. In R, a data frame is a collection of equal-length vectors; in Arrow, a Table is a collection of equal-length chunked arrays. This is convenient for me because I can use the `chunked_array()` function for the rest of this section. Instead of going through that elaborate process of creating a tibble and then calling `arrow_table()` I could have just done this:

```{r}
values <- c(TRUE, FALSE, NA)
chunked_array(values)
```

<!-- 
TODO: foreshadow that the NA, null thing will be explained later
-->



## Integer types

Integers are a little more complicated: where base R provides just the one integer type, Arrow provides eight. 

To make sense of the different types, it helps to take a moment to think about how integers are represented in a binary format. Let's suppose we allocate 8 bits to specify an integer. If we do that, then there are $2^8 = 256$ unique binary patterns we can create with these bits. Because of this, there is a fundamental constraint: no matter how we choose to set it up, 8-bit integers can only represent 256 distinct numbers. Technically, we could choose any 256 numbers we like, but in practice there are only two schemes used for 8-bit integers: *unsigned* 8-bit integers ("uint8") use those bits to represent integers from 0 to 255, whereas *signed* 8-bit integers ("int8") can represent integers from -128 to 127. 

<!-- 
TODO:

Mathematically: 
  signed = the integers, Z
  unsigned = the naturals, N
-->

More generally, an unsigned n-bit integer can represent integers from 0 to $2^n - 1$, whereas a signed n-bit integer can represent integers from $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1} - 1$. Here's what that looks like for all the integer types supported by Arrow:

| Description     | Name   | Smallest Value       |        Largest Value |
| --------------- | -----: | -------------------: | -------------------: |
| 8 bit unsigned  | uint8  | 0                    |                  255 |
| 16 bit unsigned | uint16 | 0                    |                65535 |
| 32 bit unsigned | uint32 | 0                    |           4294967295 |
| 64 bit unsigned | uint64 | 0                    | 18446744073709551615 |
| 8 bit signed    | int8   | -128                 |                  127 |
| 16 bit signed   | int16  | -32768               |                32767 |
| 32 bit signed   | int32  | -2147483648          |           2147483647 |
| 64 bit signed   | int64  | -9223372036854775808 |  9223372036854775807 |

On the R side, the integer type supplied by base R is a 32 bit signed integer, and has a natural one-to-one mapping to the Arrow int32 type. Because of this, the **arrow** default is to convert an R integer to an Arrow int32 and vice versa. 

What about the other seven Arrow types? This is where it gets a little trickier. The table above illustrates that some integer types are fully contained within others: unsurprisingly, every number representable by int16 can also be represented by int32, so we can say that the int16 numbers are fully "contained" by (i.e. are a proper subset of) the int32 numbers. Similarly, uint16 is contained by unit32. There are many cases where an unsigned type is contained by a signed type: for instance, int32 contains all the uint16 numbers. However, because the unsigned integers cannot represent negative numbers, the reverse is never true. So we can map out the relationships between the different types like this: 

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Containment relationships between the integer types."

knitr::include_graphics("img/integer-types-03.png", dpi = 350)
```

Whenever type A contains type B, it's possible to transform an object of type B into an object of type A without losing information or requiring any special handling. R integers are 32 bit signed integers, which means it's possible to convert Arrow data of types int32, int16, int8, uint16, and uint8 to R integers completely painlessly. So for these data types the **arrow** defaults give us this relationship:

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Default mappings for some integer types"

knitr::include_graphics("img/integer-types-01.png", dpi = 100)
```

Other integer types are messier. To keep things nice and simple, what we'd *like* to do is to map the Arrow uint32, uint64, and int64 types onto the R integer type. Sometimes that's possible: if all the stored values fall within the range of values representable by R integers (i.e., are between -2147483648 and 2147483647) then we can do this, and that's what **arrow** does by default. However, if there are values that "overflow" this range, then **arrow** will import the data as a different type, as shown below:

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Default mappings for other integer types"

knitr::include_graphics("img/integer-types-02.png", dpi = 100)
```

If this diagram looks ugly and unhelpful, well... yeah, I agree. Translations become messy when the boxes in one language don't quite match up to the content expressed in another. For three "big" integer types I think it's easier to just write out the translation rules verbally:

For int64: if the user sets

```{r}
integer_types <- function(value, arrow_type) {
  arrow_integer <- Scalar$create(value, arrow_type)
  r_import <- arrow_integer$as_vector()
  return(c(
    arrow = arrow_integer$type$name,
    r = class(r_import)
  ))
}
```


## Numeric types
