title: "How to mint digital art on HEN" 
description:
  Not every artist wants to make cryptoart, and that's okay. Others
  do, and that's okay too. But if you want to try it out in a 
  socially responsible way, it takes a bit of effort to get started. 
  This post attempts to make the process a little easier by walking 
  you through the whole thing, on the assumption that you are an 
  artist who (like me) has very little interest in blockchain or 
  cryptocurrency but would like to get paid and pay the rent

Cryptoart can be a touchy subject for generative artists, and it's something a lot of us have messy feelings about. In my case it is no secret that I feel conflicted: I'm on record in multiple places expressing my reservations --  [here](https://essays.djnavarro.net/post/intimacy-and-art/) and [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/data-science-art-to-support-a-womens-refuge) for example -- and I completely understand why a lot of us are uncomfortable with it. I genuinely believe there are many perfectly good reasons why a generative artist would choose not to participate. On the other hand, I also recognise that there are some very sensible reasons why a generative artist *would* want (or need) to sell NFTs: artists have to pay rent, for example. So this post isn't about passing judgment one way or the other. It's intended to be a guide to help other artists get started in this area, particularly artists in the R community, if they should decide to try it out. That's all. 

This post is also not supposed to be an introduction to blockchains or cryptocurrencies. It doesn't dive into the details on what these things are or even what an NFT is. I make art: I don't care about any of these subjects. What I'm assuming is that you're coming to this world from a similar position to me: you have a vague understanding of what blockchain is, what cryptocurrencies are about, and have a similarly vague notion that an NFT is kind of like a "digitally signed copy" of your art that you can sell to other people. That's all you need. 

## Prelude: Barriers to entry 

One thing I have noticed about the world of cryptoart is that there are *many* barriers to entry. Some barriers are obvious: if you want to sell art on [Foundation](https://foundation.app/about), for example, you need to be invited. To be invited, you need to know someone who can and will invite you. As anyone who has ever been excluded from a fancy venue by virtue of their race, gender, sexual orientation, transgender status etc can attest, an invitation requirement is a non-trivial and frequently discriminatory barrier. "By invitation" systems create entry barriers by design: for good or ill, they are inherently exclusionary.

Another kind of barrier comes from the nature of cryptoart. Blockchains were not designed to be energy efficient, and they can be extraordinarily wasteful (much more than you'd think). Environmental considerations also create barriers to entry, albeit indirect barriers. For example, the biggest cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum operate on a "proof of work" principle (often abbreviated to "PoW") and as the name suggests, operations on those chains require a lot of computational work. A lot. They are *staggeringly* wasteful, and as a consequence the total energy consumption of these chains is so high that an NFT minted on one of these chains has a very high carbon footprint. Proof of work chains are an environmental disaster, and so (in my mind) they are socially irresponsible. Don't use them if you can avoid it. This poses a problem for artists, unfortunately. The biggest cryptoart markets are based on the Ethereum chain, and that one is proof of work. True, there are plans to change this and make Ethereum more ethical, but it hasn't happened yet and I don't want to participate until the switch actually occurs. This is deeply unfortunate from artistic point of view, because it rules out [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). That sucks because OpenSea is the largest marketplace and it's very easy to get started there. For instance, I have an [unused account](https://opensea.io/djnavarro) that I set up in a few minutes. So easy! But for me the end-user convenience wasn't worth the environmental costs, so I abandoned this idea at the outset. On the plus side, OpenSea have [announced](https://blog.opensea.io/announcements/tezos-nfts-are-coming-to-opensea/) that they are planning to support the Tezos blockchain (see below), and when that day comes I will probably make use of my OpenSea account: the thing I take moral issue with is not OpenSea, it is with Ethereum. Personally, I don't want to touch the stuff.

So what are the alternatives?

The main alternative to the "proof of work" blockchains are the "proof of stake" (PoS) blockchains. These don't require anywhere near as much computation, and as a consequence are much more energy efficient. For that reason, NFTs on those chains are often called "clean NFTs". There are a multiple proof of stake chains (Tezos, Solana, etc), but the one I'm most familiar with is [Tezos](https://tezos.com/). To give you a sense of just how extreme the difference is, this is a screenshot that popped up on one of the sites while I was doing my initial exploration:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/efficiency.png")
```

Even if this claim is somewhat exaggerated for marketing purposes, the sheer scale of it is remarkable. A multiplicative factor of 1.5 million is... enormous. I could literally mint NFTs on Tezos for every single image that I have ever created for the rest of my life, and it would still be several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than minting *one* piece on Ethereum. To my way of thinking, that makes a massive difference to the moral calculus associated with minting NFTs. In fact, the difference between Tezos and Ethereum is so extreme that there is actually one art marketplace there --  [Bazaar](https://bazaarnft.xyz/) -- that is not just carbon neutral but is actually *carbon negative*. That's only possible because Tezos is so much more efficient than Ethereum, and it becomes practical for the developers to impose a carbon tax on minting: the transaction costs are used to purchase sufficient carbon offsets to ensure the system as a whole remains carbon negative. Right now I wouldn't recommend setting up on Bazaar because it's so early in development that it's hard to use, but I'm absolutely keeping an eye on it for the future!

Setting up on the Tezos blockchain is particularly appealing because it has an established digital art marketplace called "[hic et nunc](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/)". The name is Latin in origin and translates to "here and now". You'll usually see it abbreviated to "HEN", which is what I'll call it in this post, but some people use "H=N", I guess because it looks visually similar to the HEN logo. The HEN marketplace is completely open: you don't need an invitation. There's no super-secret club to be invited into (as far as I know!), and to my mind that's a huge positive. Better yet, a few folks from the R art community are already there. I'm entirely certain that there are others I don't know about yet, but so far on HEN I've already found [Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/tz/tz2Pkj2xWJovKKCsABjnr3NbyMVJTMBkpTvb/), [Will Chase](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/tz/tz1UTa3LDHvb1xvfcaH5evmsVMWNXQRxrYb2), [Antonio S. Chinch√≥n](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/tz/tz1LLd8FJJtcTfFLiJeX6UL2oYQeLLAzUH7K), and [George Savva](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/tz/tz1X5wRkNVQG7QfUg4kSpaQbBWPzCv6wf6mV). As of a few days ago, [I'm there too](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/tz/tz1hXKn2BcU64HxSrmojfuf7cDoweJ9xwxZ7). 

Openness! Community! Yay! 

If there's one thing I have learned from the lovely R folks on twitter, everything is better when you are part of a supportive team of people who actually care about each other and work to build each other up. From my perspective, this makes HEN a very attractive option. 

There is, unfortunately, a catch. There is always a catch.

One big limitation to HEN is that it isn't easy to get started there unless you are already somewhat enmeshed in the crypto world generally, or the cryptoart scene specifically. The ecosystem is distributed over several sites that have weird names without enough vowels, the user interfaces on the sites tend to be unconventional (often pointlessly so in my opinion), and the "how to" guides aren't very easy to read. The overall aesthetic and typology screams out **WE ARE THE COOL KIDS** in capital letters. It doesn't even have the good grace to be subtle about it. Taken together, all these little things add up, and it annoys me. I have been a professional educator for 15 years now, and I can absolutely guarantee that the overall effect of this is to create a de facto entry barrier. All these things act as signals to exclude people who aren't already part of the clique. It feels disproportionately uncomfortable if you're an outsider. It tells you that you're not welcome if you're not one of the cool kids. Are you one of the cool kids? No? Then sorry. No HEN for you babe.

Well, **fuck**.

About the only upside I see to the entry barriers to HEN is that I can do something to lower them. I can't do anything to make Foundation less exclusionary, and there's nothing I can do to make OpenSea less of an environmental disaster. But I can do something to HEN less confusing: I can write a blog post explaining the process. This blog post. 

So. Let's do this.

Let's assume you're not one of the cool kids. Let's assume you're just a regular human being who likes to make generative art in R, and are a little curious. You have a vague idea of what cryptocurrencies are (yeah, yeah, digital currency blah blah blah). You have a vague idea of what an NFT is (digitally signed copy of the art, whatever dude). Maaaaaybe you've sort of heard of HEN ... but that's only because you've seen some R people posting about it on twitter. And that's it. That's all you know. But maybe you want to try it out, just to see if it's for you? Just to try. But you really, really, reaaaaaalllllllly don't want to wade into all the details and you're secretly worried that it's all too complicated and you won't be able to do it. Your impostor sydrome is going *wild*. Is that you? Do you feel the same way I felt? 

If so, this post is written for you.

## 1: Get an overview

When I started setting up on, I wandered around the Tezos cryptoart landscape in confusion, wandering aimlessly over the terrain. It was all *deeply* unsettling. Eventually I pieced together some overall view of things, but I wouldn't recommend doing things the same way I did. I think the best thing to do first is to "zoom out" and look at the landscape as a whole. The best site for doing that is this one:

https://tezos.art/

The page has three sections: 

- **Marketplaces**: Sites where you can mint, buy, and sell art
- **Wallets**: Tools that handle your identity and store your funds
- **Community**: Places where you can go for help

It's worth taking a quick look at this page because it gives you a feel for what all the moving parts are, but doesn't dive into details anywhere. 

You've taken a quick peek, yes? Cool. Let's get started...

## 2: Create a wallet

It's a little counterintuitive, but the natural place to start is *not* the art marketplaces: the first thing you need is a wallet. The reason for this is that your wallet serves two distinct purposes. As the name suggests, the wallet provides a method for storing funds: the currency itself is referred to as "tezos", which you'll see abbreviated to "tez" or denoted "Íú©". However, it also serves as your unique identifier on the Tezos blockchain. On blockchains as in life it is rather hard to do anything interesting without a public identity, so you need to create one first.

Okaaaay... at this point you'd probably be wondering "where do I sign up for one of these wallets?" Excellent question. As you will have noticed by peeking at the [tezos.art](https://tezos.art) website, you have a few different options. Being offered choices is nice, of course, but it can also be anxiety-provoking when you don't even know what the differences between the options are. So, for whatever it's worth, I'll mention that I [Temple Wallet](https://templewallet.com/). I made that choice for two reasons and only two reasons. First, it was one of the options listed on the [HEN wiki](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Tezos). Second, I was complaining privately to Will Chase about how confused I was and he told me uses Temple and I copied what he did. That being said, I suspect the choice is arbitrary. 

For the sake of argument, I'll assume you decided to use Temple too. So now you're clicking through the link above in order to open an account with Temple Wallet and... wait, it's just a *browser extension*? Yup. This seems to be very common in blockchain land, and initially it struck me as bizarre. The longer I hang around there, however, the more I realise it does make a kind of sense. Once you start *doing* things on Tezos, you'll find that you have to validate everything you do. Any time you ask a website to undertake some action on your behalf, the first thing that will happen is that you'll be asked to authorise the action using your public identity. What that means is that you have to use your wallet all the time, even for things that don't cost money. A browser extension makes this a little easier. When the website asks you to authenticate, the wallet browser extension will create a little popup window that asks you to confirm the transaction. There's a bit of friction to the process sometimes, and it feels a little alien, but it does start to feel normal after a while. 

Moving on... the next little strangeness is that when you set up the wallet you don't create a username, only the password, and you'll be given a "recovery phrase", which is a sequence of 12 random words. Don't lose either of these things. Here, as always, I strongly recommend that you **use a password manager to store your password**, because there aren't that many options for recovery if you start losing passwords. Personally, I've been using [1password](https://1password.com/) for a few years and I really like it. So yes. Use a password manager, store your wallet password there and store your recovery phrase there too. 

At the end of this process you are assigned a public identity, which is a long string of complete gibberish. For example, this is me:

```
tz1hXKn2BcU64HxSrmojfuf7cDoweJ9xwxZ7
```

Naturally, the first thing I did when seeing this is groan. The second thing I did is notice the `Srmojf` substring and it made me think of [Smurfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smurfs). So I secretly think of this gibberish identifier as the `Smurf`, and that's how I'll refer to it for the rest of this post. Of course, in the long run you probably don't want to be a random string of digits, you want to have a name! This is possible to do, and I'll walk you through that later. But right now that's not a complication you need to care about.

We'll get to that a little bit later but the key thing for now is that your equivalent of the `Smurf` is both a public identifier and a bank account number. If someone wants to send you some tez, all they need to know is that string.


## 3: Tell HEN who you are


### Synchronise with your wallet

When you go to the HEN website you'll see a little bit of text on the top right hand side that has a link that says "sync". Click on that:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hen_sync.png")
```

This will bring up an ovelay that looks like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hen_wallet.png")
```

If you chose a Temple wallet choose the "Temple - Tezos Wallet (ex. Thanos)" option. It might ask for your password at this point but it probably won't if you're already logged in. What you're more likely to see is a screen like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/connect.png")
```

This is a message from your wallet asking you to confirm that yes, you do want to synchronise with HEN (it also shows you that I currently have a balance of 11 tez, which I guess is something like US$60). Click on connect, and HEN will now be synchronised with your identity. You can see that because the menu at the top now looks something like this: 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hen_synced.png")
```

You're now synced: in effect, you are now logged in to HEN. You still don't have a username, but you *have* authenticated yourself and you can now change some settings. 

### Name, avatar and bio

The time has come to give yourself a name. If you do things in the right order and with the right mental model of what's going on, this is pretty easy to do, but it's easy to get a little confused because there are actually multiple things going on here, and you always have to keep in mind that your equivalent of my `Smurf` string is your actual identity.

So... your first step is to tell HEN to link your `Smurf` strng to a name, bio and avatar. This is easy and it doesn't cost you any money. You click on the menu, and you'll see this screen:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hen_menu.png")
```

As with everything about HEN, it's very minimalist and slightly atypical, but it's just a menu, same as on any other website. Click on "edit profile". This brings up another slightly unconventional looking screen that has several options you can set. Here's what mine currently looks like:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hen_profile.png")
```

There are three "easy" options here:

- If you click on "choose file" you can give yourself an avatar
- If you type something under "username" you can have a username
- If you type something under "description" you get a bio.

For the username, you should avoid spaces and special characters, and use lowercase letters because usernames are case sensitive. For R users, that should feel familiar: we write our usernames in `snake_case` because that's what all the cool kids do, right?

Once you're happy you can click "save profile" and -- assuming that HEN isn't running slowly like was when I got set up -- you're all set. Yay!

### Linking to social media?

It's worth noticing that there are a few important things you haven't done yet. For example, when you clicked "save profile" earlier it didn't set up a twitter link, even though there is some text on the settings page that . In fact, despite the close proximity of the "save profile" button and the text underneath, those two things aren't related. It's obnoxiously hard to find in the HEN user interface, byt the words "Tezos Profiles" in that screenshot above are actually a link. Later on in this guide I'll get you to click on that link and it will let you do other things like verify your twitter account, github account etc. However, that's surprisingly finicky to do and it costs money, so leave that until later.


### Find your profile

Second... notice that your username functions as an alias, but it's only an alias. The canonical link to my user profile is this ugly thing that includes the `Smurf`:

https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/tz/tz1hXKn2BcU64HxSrmojfuf7cDoweJ9xwxZ7

However, because I've set up my username on HEN to be `djnavarro` this link will redirect automatically to a more handy profile page:

https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/djnavarro

Even so, it's important to remember that this is just a convenience, and it's specific to HEN. There are other websites that are linked to the same art ecosystem, and you'll find that your `Smurf` equivalent will tend to follow you around across those websites because that's a public identifier. In contrast, only HEN knows that I'm also `djnavarro`, so *this* alias won't necessarily follow me to other sites. But whatever. Right now that's not super important. We can deal with that later.

For more information about editing your profile, you can check out the HEN [FAQ page](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/wiki/Edit-your-profile).

## Intermission: Follow people

There's more stuff you can do to get your account set up, but you might want to take a little breather and look for some art. Maybe you want to search for someone you know in the R community who might be on HEN, and you'd like to find them. The actual HEN website isn't very good for that. If you look at the front page, all you see is art scrolling by

https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/

There's no structure, just a timeline showing the pieces one at a time as they are "minted". It's not searchable or browsable. This is annoying, but there are alternatives. After all, the actual pieces are all public and on the tezos blockchain so other sites can hook into it and display the same pieces in a different way. The "HEN explorer" website is pretty handy here:

https://www.henext.xyz/

There are things you can browse and even a search box. It's a little clunky (e.g., I found the search box didn't always act as I was expecting) but it does the job. This was how I found the other R people I knew about! So if you want to take a moment to explore, this is a pretty good place to go. 

## 4: Get a little money

Remember when I said that everything about this oozes capitalism? I really meant it: it's hard to do much without spending money, and we're rapidly reaching the point where you'll need a little bit. Thankfully, you don't need very much, and there's a good chance you can ask one of the other R folks on HEN to help out. That's what I did, and I'm grateful to the people who sent me a few tez, and the others who spontaneously offered. R people are lovely. 

If the "ask a friend" approach is an option for you, I'd recommend it for artists. The reason I say this is that you have a bigger set up cost (in terms of your time and effort) than someone who is joining in order to purchase art, so from the perspective of the artist all you need -- right now -- is a little start up fund. To use myself as the example, I made a lot of weird mistakes setting up and wasted quite a lot of transactions, but even with all that I think I only spent about 1 tez in total (at the exchange rate at the time that was about US$5). 

Assuming that you can solve the problem that way, you can take care of the other financials later (and there's a guide on how to do that coming later in the post). There's a part of me that hopes that if the R art community does end up with a larger presence on HEN, we'll look after our own. We're R folks, and we pay it forward because we care for each other. 

That being said, I'm also not naive, and I know perfectly well that it doesn't always work that way, so I'll briefly mention other options. For example, the HEN website has some suggestions for [other places](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Tezos) you can ask for help. Alternatively if you have a Visa card, one possibility is to buy through https://tzkt.io/buy-tezos (the tzkt.io site will come up later in the post!), though you'll need identification documents for this (or any other option) because it's a financial institution. Finally, you can sign up at a currency exchange, which you'll probably want to do later anyway because that's going to be how you convert the funds from your HEN sales to regular currency. I'll talk about that later on.

Regardless of how you solve this part of the problem, I'm hoping that at this point you have a few tez to start out! 


## 6: Minting and selling art


## 7: Manage your identity 

At this point you might want to take some steps to link your `Smurf` identity with your real life identity. Sure, *you* know who you are and you can attest to that fact, but the crypto world apparently wants more proof, and they are tediously fixated on non-traditional ways to do that. It annoys me, but these are the hoops artists have to jump through right? So let's do this. 

The first thing to realise (something that is *not* well signposted on the sites), is that there are at least two different systems involved and when you go googling for information you'll find information about both of them. It can get confusing. So let's take then one at a time. 

### tzprofiles.com

Go back to the HEN website, click on the menu and select "edit profile" again. Then go click on the almost-impossible-to-detect "Tezos Profiles" link that I foreshadowed earlier. That will take you to https://tzprofiles.com/, and there is a very prominent "connect wallet" button. Click on that button, confirm with your wallet that you want to allow tzprofiles to connect (the little popup window will appear, like it always does), and then you'll see a screen that looks like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tzprofiles.png")
```

There are several different things you can do here, and any of them that you verify on tzprofiles will eventually end up on HEN. For example, if you want to verify your twitter account, you'll go through a series of elaborate steps (which, yes, will have to be confirmed with your wallet) and in the end you'll be forced to send a tweet like this one:

https://twitter.com/djnavarro/status/1440133754333237248

To verify your GitHub account it's pretty similar, except that you end up being forced to create a gist. For your website it forces you to create a DNS record (which annoyed the hell out of me because it overwrote my existing DNS records and borked my webpage until I worked out how to fix it... was not pleased). Frankly I'm not sure that verifying the website is worth the effort. I wasted a lot more time on that than I wanted to. Oh well.

In any case, once you're done, I think you have to use your wallet to confirm again (I've forgotten, but I think you do) to allow HEN to use your profile on tzprofiles.com, but once you've done that, you'll see some icons appear on your HEN page, linking to your twitter account, github account, etc:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hen_profilecomplete.png")
```

At this point your HEN account is meaningfully linked to your other public identities, and any artwork you create can be verifiably be linked to *you* (and not just your `Smurf`). You can skip the next part if you want. 

### tzkt.io

All right. If you're like me you've probably been exploring as you go and you've been encountering some other sites that seem connected to this ecosystem. One of them I mentioned earlier (i.e., https://henext.xyz). But at some point you've probably clicked on a link attached to your `Smurf` and it's taken you to https://tzkt.io. Most likely it took you to a page that looks like this, and appears to be (and is) showing a bunch of transactions:

https://tzkt.io/tz1hXKn2BcU64HxSrmojfuf7cDoweJ9xwxZ7/operations/

You'll probably end up back at tzkt.io quite a bit, I suspect, because it's the place that everything seems to link to to display transactions. On my page there's is a log of all the things I've been doing on the tezos blockchain. It looks something like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tzkt_screen.png")
```

A lot of it is gibberish, but you can kind of see what's going on here. Yet again you can see my `Smurf`, there's a bunch of transactions that show me minting NFTs, etc. It makes a kind of sense.

What *doesn't* make any sense (at least not at first), is that my `Smurf` is not linked to my identity. My avatar is missing (that kitty is a randomly assigned avatar, not something I chose), and none of those links go anywhere. There's a *space* for me to have a twitter link, a github link, etc, but they are empty. That seems weird, because I already verified my twitter and github, right?

Well, yes, I did. But I verified those accounts with the other site: https://tzprofiles.com/ knows who I am and has shared that information with HEN, but it hasn't shared anything with https://tzkt.io. This is mildly annoying because other sites in the HEN ecosystem all seem to be looking to https://tzkt.io in order to get profile information about me. Unlike HEN itself, they aren't getting information from https://tzprofiles.com/. 

A good example of this is https://objkt.com/, a site that you can use to auction off your artwork rather than set fixed prices for them (more on that later!) In exactly the same way that the HEN explorer site is able to show all the artwork minted through HEN (and hence you will automatically exist on https://www.henext.xyz/ if you exist on HEN), you automatically exist on objkt.com too, and your profile page is... drumroll, please... your `Smurf`. So here's me:

https://objkt.com/profile/tz1hXKn2BcU64HxSrmojfuf7cDoweJ9xwxZ7/creations

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/objkt.png")
```

As you can see, it has my `Smurf` and it is showing pictures of art I've minted through HEN, but somehow it doesn't show anything about me! In contrast, if you look at Thomas Lin Pedersen's page there, it has an avatar, a name, and a bio.  

https://objkt.com/profile/tz2Pkj2xWJovKKCsABjnr3NbyMVJTMBkpTvb/creations

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/objkt_thomas.png")
```

In fact, come to think of it, his profile on https://tzkt.io shows the exact same avatar, name, and bio:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

No fair! I want one of those too! What magic does he know that I don't? Well, one clue is to look at his HEN page and note that the bio is slightly different, and the social media icons on his HEN page are slightly different to the social media icons on his OBJKT page:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hen_profile_thomas.png")
```

To cut a long story short, OBJKT is pulling the information from TZKT. So if you want to have a profile on OBJKT too, you'll have to verify yourself on TZKT. Gr. Luckily for me -- because I am tired of this post and I really want to get to the artistic part -- there's a good write up of how to do that on the "Baking Bad" blog:

https://baking-bad.org/blog/2021/09/19/tzkt-alias-verification-f-a-q/

It took me a while to realise that this isn't a random website, and the "baking" thing is a reference to some of the boring mechanics of how the tezos currency works. The odd name notwithstanding, the blog is associated with the folks who actually run TZKT, and I've found it helpful to browse on that page to learn more about the system itself. In any case, the long and short of it is that you'll be asked to fill out a Google Form and then wait for a few days while they manually verify the information you provide. When you do this, you'll find that it asks you to do a few tasks to prove your identity, and they're quite similar to the tasks that TZPROFILES asks you to undertake (but a bit less stringent). Eventually (hopefully), your profile will show up on TZKT and then will propagate to OBJKT. 

### tezos.domains

Okay but... what if, and hear me out... what if you don't want that fucking smurf to follow you around everywhere? What if you would like to... gasp... choose your own address. Perhaps, like me, you'd like the ability to tell people to "send tez to me at `djnavarro.tez` because that's me!". It's not exactly an unreasonable desire. Somehow, "send tez to me at `tz1hXKn2BcU64HxSrmojfuf7cDoweJ9xwxZ7` becaause that's me!" just doesn't feel the same, you know? If you'd like to do this, it is possible with the assistance of [Tezos Domains](https://tezos.domains/) and it will cost you 1 tez per year to register your very own .tez domain. 


## 8: Convert tez to dollars

At some point, hopefully very soon, you'll sell some OBJKTs and you'll want to get paid. To do that, you'll want to sign up with one of the currency exchanges. Although you probably have exactly zero interest in being a currency trader, it's a necessity if you want to get paid in real money. Sure, cryptocurrencies are "cool" and everything, but the cold hard truth of the world is that coolness does not pay the rent. My landlord expects to be paid in Australian dollars, and -- by extension -- so do I. That means exchanging your tez for regular money. The HEN wiki lists a couple of options along with the standard warning that you should definitely do your own research (this is a thing that will depend a bit on where you live). In my case I was able to go with one of their suggested options, and I signed up with [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com). The process was tedious but also very traditional: I signed up for an account, verified my identity using official documents, and linked it to my bank account. It was time consuming to complete the whole process, but also very boring. In other words it's exactly what you'd expect from any financial institution.
