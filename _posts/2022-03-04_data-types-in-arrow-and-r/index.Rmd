title: "Data types in Arrow and R" 
description:
  A post describing fundamental data types in R and 
  Apache Arrow, and how data is exchanged between the two systems.
  It covers conversion of logicals, integers, floats, decimals, 
  strings, date, and times, among other things. It talks about 
  higher level structures like tables, data frames, and so on
  For reasons that now escape me, esoteric authors are quoted, and 
  I try to bribe the audience into reading the whole thing by 
  adding artwork. This post is, um... long

TODO: 

Insert the point from conversation with Jon. The code the read_* functions is
complicated. It handles everything for you because "reading the data" is a 
constrained task. That means the developers can optimise almost everything. 

In contrast, the code underpinning schema() etc is simple. It takes care of 
choices for you when those choices are "obvious", but it leaves all the edge
cases for you to deal with. There are a lot of weird edge cases because 
"translating between languages" is underdetermined and can only ever be 
approximate. The developers can help make it easier, but the user has to be
the final arbiter, and it helps to understand what each language is "doing". 

-->

Consider this piece of magic

```{r}
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(arrow)

magicians <- read_csv_arrow("magicians.csv")
magicians

arrowmagicks <- arrow_table(magicians)
arrowmagicks
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
conflicted::conflict_prefer("timestamp", "arrow")
```

The `magicians` data set is a "data frame" (a tibble, technically) stored in R. The `arrowmagicks` data set, however, is a pointer to a data structure stored in Arrow. That data structure is a "Table" object. Arrow Tables are roughly analogous to data frames -- both represent tabular data with columns that may be of different types -- but they are not the same. An act of *translation* has occurred. Similarly when we look at the individual columns we see that something similar has happened. "Integer" columns in R are mapped to "int32" columns in Arrow, "Date" columns in R become "date32" columns in Arrow, and so on. Even without knowing much about the data types in the two languages, you can infer a lot from the names! In this case you can reasonably (and correctly) infer that the translation from R to Arrow is a sensible one. Better yet, in this case, when we pull the `arrowmagicks` data back into R we recover the original data:

```{r}
collect(arrowmagicks)
```

In this example the translation back and forth "just works". You really don't have to think too much about the subtle differences in how Arrow and R "think about the world" and how their data structures are organised. And in general that's what we *want* in a multi-language toolbox: we want the data analyst to be thinking about the data, not the cross-linguistic subtleties of the data structures! 

## Defining schemas

That being said, it's also valuable to give the data analyst flexibility. The **arrow** package makes very sensible default choices about how to translate an R data structure into an Arrow data structure, but those choices can never be more than defaults because of the fundamental fact that the languages are inherently different. The quote about the [indeterminacy of translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminacy_of_translation) at the top of this post was originally written about natural languages, but I think it applies in programming too. There's no "single" rulebook that tells you how to translate between R and Arrow: there can't be. 

Suppose that I knew that there would in fact be a "Season 5.1648" coming, consisting of a single episode whose title corresponded to the full text of the [Treaty of Westphalia](https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2008/MVZ430/um/Treaty-of-Westphalia.pdf) or, worse, several gigabytes worth of Wikipedia text.^[I mean, if my data set were a [Fiona Apple discography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_the_Pawn...) this would be a real possibility right?] Knowing that this new data point is coming, I'd perhaps want my Arrow data to encode `season` as a numeric variable, and I'd probably want to recognise that the text in the `title` field can be quite long. To do that I can specify an explicit *schema* that tells the **arrow** package how to translate my R data set into Arrow. I can do this with the `schema()` function:

```{r}
translation <- schema(
  season = float64(), # not the default
  episode = int32(),
  title = large_utf8(), # not the default
  air_date = date32(),
  rating = float64(),
  viewers = float64()
)
```

Now I can use my schema to govern the translation:

```{r}
arrowmagicks2 <- arrow_table(magicians, schema = translation)
arrowmagicks2
```

This is of course a very silly example. But the underlying issue is fairly serious. 

## Why mapping languages is hard

Blah blah I used to teach categorisation and mental representation. Organising the world into concepts (or data structures) is hard. We define ontologies that impose order on a chaotic world. A famous attempt to do this in 1668 by John Wilkins in [An Essay Towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/_/BCCtZjBtiEYC?hl=en&gbpv=1). A small snippet taken from the section "On Beasts":

> BEASTS, may be distinguished by their several shapes, properties, uses, food, their tameness or wildness, etc. into such as are either
>

>             - DOG-KIND; whose *heads* are *more oblong*. V.
>             
> - OVIPAROUS; breeding *Eggs*. VI.

It goes on to elaborate. As a scientific taxonomy it's... interesting. But even psychologically it betrays the peculiarities of the author. Wilkins had the noble ambition of defining a "universal language", but as a 17th century English gentleman there are certain deficiencies! I note as an Australian that there's no distinction between placental and marsupial mammals here! But of course the problems are more general. In 1952 the Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges published an essay called [The Analytical Language of John Wilkins](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/155/assignment/ex1/Borges.pdf) and describes a classification system from an fictitious "Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge":

> In its remote pages it is written that the animals are divided into: (a) belonging to the emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) sucking pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present classification, (i) frenzied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, (l) et cetera, (m) having just broken the water pitcher, (n) that from a long way off look like flies

It's pretty unlikely that any human language would produce a classification system quite as chaotic as Borges' fictional example, but the point is well made. Actual classification systems used in different languages and cultures are very different to one another and often feel very alien when translated. Michel Foucault actually refers to this Borges passage in the preface to his famous work [The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Order_of_Things) on how different cultures and historical periods viewed the world from fundamentally different perspectives. According to Foucault, Borges essay 

> shattered ... all the familiar landmarks of thought --- our thought, the thought that bears the stamp of our age and our geography --- breaking up all the ordered surfaces and all the planes with which we are accustomed to tame the wild profusion of existing things



## Translating data types

So how do we construct data structures in Arrow that are appropriate translations of data structures in R, and vice versa? For the moment, let's keep things simple and assume that the mapping we're interested in has the same format as the one described at the start of the post: in R we want to encode the data as a data frame, and in Arrow we want to encode it as a Table. If so, the translation question is really a matter of how we encode the columns.

In the rest of this post I'll use a lot of diagrams showing the default mappings that the **arrow** package uses when converting data columns from R to Arrow and vice versa. In each case I'll show R data types on the left hand side (against a blue background) and Arrow data types on the right hand side (against an orange background), as shown below:

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Illustration of the graphical convention used in the later   diagrams, showing R on the left side (against a blue background) and Arrow on the right side (against an orange background)."

knitr::include_graphics("img/visual-convention.png", dpi = 100)
```

<aside><br>Instead of using alt-text, I've included verbose and descriptive figure captions that verbally describe the content of each diagram</aside>

## Logical types

<!-- 
TODO: add discussion of two-valued and three-valued logics here
-->

I'll start with the simplest possible case: a data frame with one column of logical data. Logical data in R can take on three possible values: `TRUE` and `FALSE` are the two allowed truth values, and `NA` is used to denote missing data. 

```{r}
df <- tibble(values = c(TRUE, FALSE, NA))
df
```

Arrow has an analogous "boolean" type, which has truth values `true` and `false`. Just like R, missing values are allowed, and are represented as `null`. Arrow booleans and R logicals are essentially equivalent to one another, so by default the **arrow** package will map an R logical to an Arrow boolean and vice versa.

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Default mappings for logical types"

knitr::include_graphics("img/logical-types.png", dpi = 100)
```

So let's do it:

```{r}
tb <- arrow_table(df)
tb
```

It's mildly annoying this doesn't print out the actual values. Happily the **arrow** package supplies a `$` operator for Arrow Table objects so we can do this:

```{r}
tb$values
```

Okay, that makes sense. The "ChunkedArray" bit might seem a little unfamiliar to R users -- and I'll come back to it later -- but for now we can imagine it's something similar to an R vector. 

This also tells us a little more about the relationship between R data frames and Arrow Tables. In R, a data frame is a collection of equal-length vectors; in Arrow, a Table is a collection of equal-length chunked arrays. This is convenient for me because I can use the `chunked_array()` function for the rest of this section. Instead of going through that elaborate process of creating a tibble and then calling `arrow_table()` I could have just done this:

```{r}
values <- c(TRUE, FALSE, NA)
chunked_array(values)
```


<!-- 
TODO: foreshadow that the NA, null thing will be explained later
-->

In fact, I could have done this in an even more primitive way and passed a scalar value to Arrow. That's not something you usually find yourself needing to do, so the **arrow** package doesn't have an equivalent of `chunked_array()` that applies to scalars. However, most of the heavy lifting for `chunked_array()` is actually being done by the R6 object `ChunkedArray`.^[In general R6 classes use UpperCamelCase, and the snake_case functions with the same name provide an interface to the R6 class that feels more familiar to an R user.] There is a `Scalar` R6 object that we can use to import scalars:

```{r}
Scalar$create(TRUE, type = boolean())
```

In the same way that `chunked_array()` is an alias for `ChunkedArray$create()`, for the purpose of this post I'm going to define `scalar()` as an alias for `Scalar$create()`

```{r}
scalar <- function(x, type = NULL) {
  Scalar$create(x, type)
}

scalar(TRUE, type = boolean())
```


## Integer types

When translating R logicals to Arrow booleans, there aren't a lot of conceptual difficulties. R has one data structure and Arrow has one data structure, and they're basically identical. This is easy. Integers, however, are a little trickier because there's no longer an exact mapping between the two languages. Base R provides one kind of integer data, but Arrow provides eight distinct integer types. As a consequence it will no longer be possible to provide one-to-one mappings between R and Arrow, and some choices have to be made. As we'll see in this section, the **arrow** package tries very hard to set sensible default choices, and in most cases these will work seamlessly. It's not something you actually have to think about much. But, as my friend Dan Simpson reminds me over and over, God is in the sweeping gestures but the Devil is in the details. 

It is wise to look carefully at the details, so let's do that. 

### [Arrow] Eight types of integer

To make sense of the different types, it helps to take a moment to think about how integers are represented in a binary format. Let's suppose we allocate 8 bits to specify an integer. If we do that, then there are $2^8 = 256$ unique binary patterns we can create with these bits. Because of this, there is a fundamental constraint: no matter how we choose to set it up, 8-bit integers can only represent 256 distinct numbers. Technically, we could choose any 256 numbers we like, but in practice there are only two schemes used for 8-bit integers: *unsigned* 8-bit integers ("uint8") use those bits to represent integers from 0 to 255, whereas *signed* 8-bit integers ("int8") can represent integers from -128 to 127. 

More generally, an unsigned n-bit integer can represent integers from 0 to $2^n - 1$, whereas a signed n-bit integer can represent integers from $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1} - 1$. Here's what that looks like for all the integer types supported by Arrow:

| Description     | Name   | Smallest Value       |        Largest Value |
| --------------- | -----: | -------------------: | -------------------: |
| 8 bit unsigned  | uint8  | 0                    |                  255 |
| 16 bit unsigned | uint16 | 0                    |                65535 |
| 32 bit unsigned | uint32 | 0                    |           4294967295 |
| 64 bit unsigned | uint64 | 0                    | 18446744073709551615 |
| 8 bit signed    | int8   | -128                 |                  127 |
| 16 bit signed   | int16  | -32768               |                32767 |
| 32 bit signed   | int32  | -2147483648          |           2147483647 |
| 64 bit signed   | int64  | -9223372036854775808 |  9223372036854775807 |

### [R] One integer class

On the R side, the integer type supplied by base R is a 32 bit signed integer, and has a natural one-to-one mapping to the Arrow int32 type. Because of this, the **arrow** default is to convert an R integer to an Arrow int32 and vice versa. Here's an example. I've been watching [Snowpiercer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowpiercer_(TV_series)) lately, and the train is currently 1029 cars long so let's pass the integer `1029L` from R over to Arrow

```{r}
snowpiercer <- scalar(1029L)
snowpiercer
```

Let's inspect the `type` field of the `snowpiercer` object in order to determine what type of object has arrived in Arrow:

```{r}
snowpiercer$type
```

Similarly, we can use the `as_vector()` method of the `snowpiercer` object to pull the data back into R, and hopefully it comes as no surprise to see that we get the same number back:

```{r}
snowpiercer$as_vector()
```

We can take this one step further to check that the returned object is actually an R integer by checking its `class()`, and again there are no surprises:

```{r}
class(snowpiercer$as_vector())
```

As you can see, the default behaviour in **arrow** is to translate an R integer into an Arrow int32, and vice versa. That part, at least, is not too complicated.

That being said, it's worth unpacking some of the mechanics of what I'm doing with the code here. Everything I've shown above is R code, so it's important to keep it firmly in mind that when I create the `snowpiercer` object there are two different things happening: a *data* object is created inside Arrow, and a *pointer* to that object is created inside R. The `snowpiercer` object is that pointer (it's actually an R6 object). When I called `snowpiercer$type` in R, the output is telling me that the data object in Arrow has type "int32". There's a division of responsibility between R and Arrow that always needs to be kept in mind. 

Now, in this particular example there's an element of silliness because my data object is so tiny. There was never a good reason to put the data in Arrow, and the only reason I'm doing it here is for explanatory purposes. But in real life (like in the TV shoe), `snowpiercer` might in fact be a gargantuan monstrosity over which you have perilously little control due to it's staggering size. In that case it makes a big difference where the data object is stored. Placing the data object in Arrow is a little bit like powering your 1029-car long train using the fictitious perpetual motion engine from the show: it is a really, really good idea when you have gargantuan data.^[Okay that was a tortured metaphor and one that I probably don't want to push too far given that *Snowpiercer* is a terrifyingly dark show filled with horrible, horrible people. I'm nice though. Honest! Would I lie to you?]

### When integer translation is easy

What about the other seven Arrow types? This is where it gets a little trickier. The table above illustrates that some integer types are fully contained within others: unsurprisingly, every number representable by int16 can also be represented by int32, so we can say that the int16 numbers are fully "contained" by (i.e. are a proper subset of) the int32 numbers. Similarly, uint16 is contained by unit32. There are many cases where an unsigned type is contained by a signed type: for instance, int32 contains all the uint16 numbers. However, because the unsigned integers cannot represent negative numbers, the reverse is never true. So we can map out the relationships between the different types like this: 

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Containment relationships between the integer types."

knitr::include_graphics("img/integer-types-03.png", dpi = 350)
```

Whenever type A contains type B, it's possible to transform an object of type B into an object of type A without losing information or requiring any special handling. R integers are 32 bit signed integers, which means it's possible to convert Arrow data of types int32, int16, int8, uint16, and uint8 to R integers completely painlessly. So for these data types the **arrow** defaults give us this relationship:

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Default mappings for some integer types"

knitr::include_graphics("img/integer-types-01.png", dpi = 100)
```

These are the cases where it is easy. 

### When integer translation is hard

Other integer types are messier. To keep things nice and simple, what we'd *like* to do is to map the Arrow uint32, uint64, and int64 types onto the R integer type. Sometimes that's possible: if all the stored values fall within the range of values representable by R integers (i.e., are between -2147483648 and 2147483647) then we can do this, and that's what **arrow** does by default. However, if there are values that "overflow" this range, then **arrow** will import the data as a different type. That leads to a rather messy diagram, I'm afraid:

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Default mappings for other integer types. The asterisk notation here is intended to indicate that the path **arrow** follows can depend on the data values and other settings."

knitr::include_graphics("img/integer-types-02.png", dpi = 100)
```


Translations become messy when the boxes in one language don't quite match up to the content expressed in another. Sometimes it's just easier to see the system in action, so let's write a little helper function:

```{r}
translate_integer <- function(value, type) {
  fn <- function(value, type) {
    tibble(
      value = value,
      arrow_type = scalar(value, type)$type$name,
      r_class = class(scalar(value, type)$as_vector())
    )
  }
  purrr::map2_dfr(value, type, fn)
}
```

The `translate_integer()` function takes a `value` vector and a `type` list as input, and it returns a tibble that tells you what Arrow type was created from each input, and what R class gets returned when we import that Arrow object back into R. I'll pass the inputs in as doubles originally, but as you'll see they always get imported to Arrow as integers because that's what I'm telling **arrow** to do. So let's start with an easy case. The number 10 is unproblematic because it's very small, and **arrow** never encounters any problem trying to pull it back as an R integer:

```{r}
translate_integer(
  value = c(10, 10, 10, 10), 
  type = list(uint8(), uint32(), uint64(), int64())
)
```

Okay, that makes sense. If the numbers *can* be represented using the R integer class then that's what **arrow** will do. Why make life unnecessarily difficult for the user?

Now let's increase the number to a value that is too big to store as a signed 32-bit integer. This is a value that R cannot represent as an integer, but Arrow can store as a uint32, uint64 or int64. What happens when we try to pull that object back into R?

```{r}
translate_integer(
  value = c(3000000000, 3000000000, 3000000000), 
  type = list(uint32(), uint64(), int64())
)
```

The first two rows seem intuitive. In base R, whenever an integer overflows and becomes to large to store, R will coerce it to a double. This is exactly the same behaviour we'd observe if the data had never left R at all. The third row, however, might come as a bit of a surprise. It certainly surprised me the first time I encountered it. Until very recently I did not know that R even *had* an integer64 class. This class is supplied by the **bit64** package, and although I'm not going to talk about it in any detail here, it provides a mechanism to represent signed 64-bit integers in R. However, the one thing I will mention is the fact that the existence of the integer64 class opens up the possibility of forcing **arrow** to always map the integer64 class to the int64 type and vice versa. If you set

```{r}
options(arrow.int64_downcast = FALSE)
```

it will change the **arrow** default so that int64 types are always returned as integer64 classes, even when the values are small enough that the data could have been mapped to a regular R integer. This can be helpful in situations where you need to guarantee type stability when working with int64 data. Now that I've altered the global options, I can repeat my earlier command with the number 10.

```{r}
translate_integer(
  value = c(10, 10, 10, 10), 
  type = list(uint8(), uint32(), uint64(), int64())
)
```

Notice that the results change for the int64 type only. The "int64_downcast" option pertains only to the int64 type, and does not affect the other integer types. 

And that's it for integers. Next up we'll talk about numeric types, but first I'll be a good girl and restore my options to their previous state:

```{r}
options(arrow.int64_downcast = NULL)
```


## Numeric types

In the last section I talked about the rather extensive range of data types that Arrow has to represent integers. Sure, there's a practical benefit to having all these different data types, but at the same time its wild that we even *need* so many different data structures to represent something so simple. Integers aren't complicated things. We learn them as kids even before we go to school, and we get taught the arithmetic rules to operate on them very early in childhood. 

The problem, though, is that there are *a lot* of integers. It's a tad inconvenient sometimes, but the set of integers is infinite in size,^[Rest assured, dear reader, while I am entirely aware of the distinction between countably and uncountably infinite sets, and have been forced to learn more about the cardinality of transfinite numbers than any human deserves to endure, I will not be discussing any of that in this post. The word "infinite" is perfectly serviceable for our purposes, and if anyone even *tries* to discuss this with me further on twitter I will be forced to engage the services of a very unpleasant lawyer...] so it doesn't matter how many bits you allocate to your "int" type, there will always be integers that your machine cannot represent. But this is obvious, so why am I saying it? Mostly to foreshadow that things get worse when we encounter...

### Floating point numbers and the desert of the reals

> To dissimulate is to pretend not to have what one has. To simulate is to feign to have what one doesn't have. One implies a presence, the other an absence. But it is more complicated than that because simulating is not pretending: "Whoever fakes an illness can simply stay in bed and make everyone believe he is ill. Whoever simulates an illness produces in himself some of the symptoms" (Littré). Therefore, pretending, or dissimulating, leaves the principle of reality intact: the difference is always clear, it is simply masked, whereas simulation threatens the difference between the "true" and the "false," the "real" and the "imaginary." <br>
> &nbsp; &nbsp; -- Jean Baudrillard, 1981, [Simulacra and Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation)^[The "desert of the real" phrase in the title of the section refers to the real numbers, but it's also a quote from *Simulacra and Simulation* and *The Matrix*. Obviously I encountered it in *The Matrix* first because, all appearances to the contrary, I am uncultured swine.]

The real numbers correspond to our intuitive concept of the continuous number line. Just like the integers, the real line extends infinitely far in both directions, but unlike the integers the reals are continuous: for any two real numbers -- no matter how close they are to each other -- there is *always* another real number in between. This, quite frankly, sucks. Because the moment you accept that this is true, something ugly happens. If I accept that there must exist a number between 1.01 and 1.02, which I'll call 1.015, then I have to accept that there is a number between 1.01 and 1.015, which I'll call 1.0075, and then I have to accept that... oh shit this is going to go on forever. In other words, the reals have the obnoxious property that there between any two real numbers there are an infinity of other real numbers. 

Try shoving all *that* into your finite-precision machine. 

Stepping away from the mathematics for a moment, most of us already know how programming languages attempt to solve the problem. They use [floating point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) as a crude tool to approximate the real numbers using a finite-precision machine, and it... sort of works, as long as you you never forget that floating point numbers don't always obey the normal rules of arithmetic. I imagine most people reading this post already know this but for those that don't, I'll show you the most famous example:

```{r}
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
```

This is not a bug in R. It happens because `0.1`, `0.2`, and `0.3` are *not* real numbers in the mathematical sense. Rather, they are encoded in R as objects of type double, and a double is a 64-bit floating point number that adheres to the [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) standard. It's a bit beyond the scope of this post to dig all the way into the IEEE standard, but it does help a lot to have a general sense of *how* a floating point number (approximately) encodes a real number, so in the next section I'm going to take a look under the hood of R doubles. I'll show you how they're represented as binary objects, and why they misbehave sometimes. I'm doing this for two reasons: firstly it's just a handy thing to know, but secondly, understanding the misbehaviour of the "standard" binary floating point number representation used in R helps motivate why Arrow and some other platforms expose a wider variety of options to the user.

### [R] The numeric class

To give you a better feel for what a double looks like when represented as a set of bits, I've written a little extractor function called `unpack_double()` that decomposes the object into its constituent bits and prints it out in a visually helpful way (ADD LINK TO SOURCE). In truth, it's just a wrapper around the `numTobits()` function provided by base R, but one that gives slighly prettier output. Armed with this, let's take a look at the format. To start out, I'll do the most boring thing possible and show you the binary representation of `0` as a floating point number. You will, I imagine, be entirely unshocked to discover that it is in fact a sequence of 64 zeros:

```{r}
unpack_double(0)
```

Truly amazing. Really, the only thing that matters here is to notice the spacing. The sequence of 64 bits are divided into three meaningful chunks. The first bit^[Sigh. Technically, this is the last bit. R uses a [little endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) representation here, but for the love of all that is good and precious in this world please let me simplify a few things okay?] represents the *sign*: is this a positive number (first bit equals 0) or a negative number (first bit equals 1), where zero is treated as if it were a positive number. The next 11 bits are used to specify an *exponent*: you can think of these bits as if they describe a signed "int11" type, and can be used to store any number between -1022 and 1023.^[Okay, if you were reading closely earlier you might be thinking this is wrong and the range should be -1023 to 1024. The reason it's not is that those to values are reserved for "special" numbers.] The remaining 53 bits are used to represent the *mantissa*. 

These three components carve up a real number by using this this decomposition:

$$
(\mbox{real number}) = (\mbox{sign}) \times (\mbox{mantissa}) \times 2 ^ {\mbox{(exponent)}}
$$
Any real number can decomposed in this way, so long as you have enough digits to express your mantissa and your exponent (which, of course, we don't). But the neat thing is about using it is that we can describe very large numbers this way and very small numbers this way. As an example, let's take a look at the partial decimal expansion of `-9.832`, which I am told is the approximate rate of acceleration experienced by a falling object in the Earth's polar regions:

```{r}
polar_g <- unpack_double(-9.832)
polar_g
```

I wrote some extractor functions that convert those binary components to the sign, exponent, and mantissa values that they represent, so let's take a look at those:

```{r, results='hold'}
extract_sign(polar_g)
extract_exponent(polar_g)
extract_mantissa(polar_g)
```

Notice that the sign is always represented exactly: it can only be -1 or 1. The exponent is also represented exactly, as long as it's not too large or too small: the number is always an integer value between -1022 and 1023. The mantissa, however, is a fractional value. When you encounter floating point errors it's generally going to be because the stored mantissa doesn't represent the true mantissa with sufficient precision.^[In fact, one of the shitty things about the reals (which are uncountably infinite) is that almost all reals have infinitely long mantissas. Even if you had a infinite number of digits to work with (a countably infinite set) you're still in trouble. Everything sucks, real numbers are almost surely uncomputable (yes that's an actual result), and I don't want to think about it any more and I need a lie down.] In any case, let's check that the formula works:

```{r}
sign <- extract_sign(polar_g)
exponent <- extract_exponent(polar_g)
mantissa <- extract_mantissa(polar_g)

sign * mantissa * 2 ^ exponent
```

Yay!

Just to prove to you that this isn't a fluke, I also included a `repack_double()` function automates this calculation. It takes the deconstructed representation of an R double and packs it up again, so `repack_double(unpack_double(x))` should return `x`. Here are a few examples: 

```{r, results='hold'}
sanity_check <- function(x) {
  x == repack_double(unpack_double(x))
}
sanity_check(12)
sanity_check(1345234623462342)
sanity_check(0.000000002345345234523)
```

Now that we have some deeper knowledge of what doubles in R actually *are*, let's return to the numbers in the famous example of floating point numbers misbehaving:

```{r, results='hold'}
unpack_double(.1)
unpack_double(.2)
unpack_double(.3)
```

Although these are clean numbers with a very simple decimal expansion, they are not at all simple when written in a binary floating point representation. In particular, notice that `0.1` and `0.2` share the same mantissa but `0.3` has a different mantissa, and that's where the truncation errors occur. Let's take a peek at `0.6` and `0.9`:

```{r, results='hold'}
unpack_double(.6)
unpack_double(.8)
unpack_double(.9)
```

So it turns out that `0.6` has the same mantissa as `0.3`, and `0.8` has the same mantissa as `0.1` and `0.2`, but  `0.9` has a different mantissa from all of them. So what we might expect is that floating point errors can happen for these cases:

```{r, results='hold'}
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
0.3 + 0.6 == 0.9
```

but not these ones:

```{r, results='hold'}
0.1 + 0.1 == 0.2
0.3 + 0.3 == 0.6
0.2 + 0.6 == 0.8
```

Okay that checks out! Now, it's important to recognise that these errors are very small. Floating point arithmetic doesn't *actually* work, but it's very close:

```{r}
0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3
```

Ultimately, floating point numbers are a simulation in the sense described by Baudrillard at the start of this section. They are a pretense, an attempt to act as if we can encode a thing (the reals) that we cannot encode. Floating point numbers are a fiction, but they are an extraordinarily useful one because they allow us to "cover" a very wide span of numbers across the real line, at a pretty high level of precision, without using too much memory. 

We pretend that machines can do arithmetic on the reals. They can't, but it's a *very* powerful lie. 

### [Arrow] The float64 type

Okay. That was terribly long-winded, and I do apologise. Nevertheless, I promise there is a point to this story and it's time we switched back over to the Arrow side of things to think about what happens there.

By now you're probably getting used to the fact that Arrow tends to have more primitive types than R in most situations. Floating point numbers are no exception. R has only a single class, usually referred to as numeric but sometimes called double. In contrast, Arrow has four: float64, float32, float16, and decimal.^[Some precision is needed here: in this post I am using the names that appear in the [documentation to the **arrow** R package](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/data-type.html). I'm doing this because the intended audience is an R user who wants to use the **arrow** package to interact with Arrow. However, you should be aware that these types are given slightly different names in the [documentation to the Arrow C++ library](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/datatype.html) to which **arrow** provides bindings. In that documentation the terminology is as follows: float64 is called double, float32 is called float, and float16 is called half-float. The decimal type is the same in both versions.] The easiest of these to discuss is float64, because it adopts the same conventions as the R double class. Just like R, it uses 64 bits to represent a floating point number.^[They are both little-endian too.] Because the data structures are so similar, the default behaviour in **arrow** is to translate an R double into an Arrow float64 and vice versa. 

As always, I've got a little diagram summarising all the default mappings:

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Default mappings for numeric types"

knitr::include_graphics("img/numeric-types.png", dpi = 100)
```

```{r}
float_01 <- scalar(0.1)
float_01
float_01$type
```

```{r}
float_02 <- scalar(0.2)
float_03 <- scalar(0.3)
float_01 + float_02 - float_03
```

### [Arrow] The float32 and float16 types

The float64 type provides an excellent, high precision floating point representation of numeric data. As data types go it is a good type. However, it is a 64-bit type, and sometimes you don't need to store your data at a high degree of precision. With that in mind, because Arrow places a strong emphasis on both scalability and efficiency, it also provides the float32 and float16 types. Encoding numeric data in these formats will save space, but will come at a cost of precision. As always, the decision of what encoding works best for your application will depend on what your needs are. 

As far as the **arrow** package is concerned, there are no difficulties in passing data back and forth between R doubles and Arrow float32 types, but due to the drastic differences in precision it's not really possible to do this with float16. Still, we can briefly take a look at how it works for float32. Here's an example of me passing an R double to Arrow:

```{r}
float32_01 <- scalar(.1, type = float32())
float32_01
```

Let's quickly verify that it is in fact a 32-bit float:

```{r}
float32_01$type
```

And now let's pull it back into R where it will be, once again, encoded as a double:

```{r}
float32_01$as_vector()
```

Yay! It works!

### Decimal floating point numbers?

Earlier in this section I promised that the Baudrillard quote from *Simulacra and Simulation* was going to be relevant? Well, that time has arrived. It's also the moment at which the quote from *Word and Object* by Quine that opened this blog post becomes painfully relevant. Stripped of their fancy language, here's what the two authors are telling us in these passages:

- The Baudrillard quote emphasises that floating point numbers are a *simulation*. They are the mechanism by which we pretend to encode real numbers on computers. It's a lie, but it's a powerful lie that almost works.
- The Quine quote emphasises that translation (and, I would argue, simulation also) is *underdetermined*. For any complicated thing there are many ways to simulate, or translate, or approximate it. These approximations can be extremely accurate and still be inconsistent with each other. 

Quine's truism applies to floating point numbers, and it is the reason why we have "decimal floating point" numbers as well as "binary floating point" numbers. All floating point systems are simulations in the Baudrillard sense of the term: lies, strictly speaking, but close enough to true that the distinction between lies and truth gets a little blurry. 

Let's see how that plays out with floating point numbers. When discussing doubles in R, I mentioned that they represent the real numbers using a decomposition that looks like this:

$$
(\mbox{real number}) = (\mbox{sign}) \times (\mbox{mantissa}) \times 2 ^ {\mbox{(exponent)}}
$$

The number "2" pops out here, doesn't it? Is there any reason to think that "2" is a pre-ordained necessity when approximating the real numbers on a finite-precision machine? Programmers have a tendency to like using "2" as the base unit for everything because it lines up nicely with binary representations, and that's often a good instinct when dealing with machines.

Unfortunately, life consists of more than machines.

In particular, binary representations create problems for floating point arithmetic because the world contains *humans* who write numbers in decimal notation^[That's assuming we're writing numbers in Arabic number system. I suppose it would be different if our orthographic representations adopted the [Sumerian sexagesimal notation](http://www.mathematicsmagazine.com/Articles/TheSumerianMathematicalSystem.php). Admittedly, neither R nor Arrow existed at the time, so it's a moot point. All I'm really saying is that decimal systems are no less arbitrary than binary ones. The problem arises because of the mismatch, not because one encoding is inherently better than the other.]. Numbers that look simple in decimal notation often look complicated in binary notation and vice versa. As we saw earlier, a "simple" decimal number like 0.1 doesn't have a short binary expansion and so cannot be represented cleanly in a finite-precision binary floating point number system. Rounding errors are introduced every time a machine uses (base 2) floating point to encode data that were originally stored as a (base 10) number in human text.

A natural solution to this is to design floating point data types that use other bases. It is entirely possible to adopt [decimal floating point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_floating_point) types that are essentially equivalent to the more familiar binary floating point numbers, but they rely on a base 10 decomposition:

$$
(\mbox{real number}) = (\mbox{sign}) \times (\mbox{mantissa}) \times 10 ^ {\mbox{(exponent)}}
$$

As we'll see in the next section, what Arrow actually does is slightly different to this. Instead of using floating-point decimals, it supplies fixed-point decimal types. In a floating-point representation, the exponent is chosen automatically, and is a property of the value itself. The number `-9.832` will always have an exponent of 3 when encoded as a binary floating-point number (as we saw in the `polar_g` example earlier), and that exponent will never be influenced by the values of other numbers stored in the same data set. 

A fixed-point representation is different. The exponent -- and in a decimal representation, remember that the exponent is just "the location of the decimal point" -- is chosen by the user. You have to specify where the decimal point is located manually, and this location will be applied to each value stored in the object. In other words, the exponent -- which is now called the "scale", and is parameterised slightly differently -- becomes a property of the type, not the value. 

Sigh. Nothing in life is simple, is it? It'll become a little clearer in the next section, I promise!

### [Arrow] The decimal fixed-point types

Arrow has two decimal types, a decimal128 type that (shockingly) uses 128 bits to store a floating point decimal number, and a decimal256 type that uses 256 bits. As usual **arrow** package supplies type functions `decimal128()` and `decimal256()` that allow you to specify decimal types. Both functions have two arguments that you must supply:

- `precision` specifies the number of significant digits to store, similar to setting the length of the mantissa in a floating-point representation. 

- `scale` specifies the number of digits that should be stored after the decimal point. If you set `scale = 2`, exactly two digits will be stored after the decimal point. If you set `scale = 0`, values will be rounded to the nearest whole number. Negative scales are also permitted (handy when dealing with extremely large numbers), so `scale = -2` stores the value to the nearest 100.

One convenience that exists both in the **arrow** R package and within the underlying Arrow C++ library is that it can automatically decide whether you need a decimal128 or a decimal256 simply by looking at the value of the `precision` argument. If the `precision` is 38 or less, you can encode the data with a decimal128 type. Larger values require a decimal256. If you would like to take advantage of this -- as I will do in this post -- you can use the `decimal()` type function which will automatically create the appropriate type based on the specified precision. 

One inconvenience that I have in this post, however, is that R doesn't have any analog of a fixed-point decimal, and consequently I don't have any way to create an "R decimal" that I can then import into Arrow. What I'll do instead is create a floating point array in Arrow, and then explicitly cast it to a decimal type. Step one, create the floating point numbers in Arrow:

```{r}
floats <- chunked_array(c(.01, .1, 1, 10, 100), type = float32())
floats
```

Step two, cast the floats to decimals: 

```{r}
decimals <- floats$cast(decimal(precision = 5, scale = 2))
decimals
```

These two arrays look almost the same (especially because I chose the `scale` judiciously!), but the underlying encoding is different. The original `floats` array is a familiar float32 type, but if we have a look at the `decimals` object we see that it adopts a quite different encoding:

```{r}
decimals$type
```

To illustrate that these do behave differently, let's have fun making floating point numbers misbehave again:

```{r}
sad_floats <- chunked_array(c(.1, .2, .3))
sum(sad_floats)
```

Oh noes. Okay, let's take a sad float and turn it into a happy decimal. I'll store it as a high precision decimal to make it a little easier to compare the results:

```{r}
happy_decimals <- sad_floats$cast(decimal(20, 16))
```

Now let's look at the two sums side by side:

```{r, results='hold'}
sum(sad_floats)
sum(happy_decimals)
```

Yay!

As a final note before moving on, it is (of course!!!) the case that fixed-point decimals aren't a universal solution to the problems of binary floating-point numbers. They have severe limitations of their own and there are very good reasons why floats remain the default almost everywhere. But they have their uses: binary and decimal systems provide different ways to simulate the reals, as to fixed and floating point systems. Each such system is a lie, of course: the reals are too big to be captured in any finite system we create. They are, however, useful.

## Character types

Our journey continues. We now leave behind the world of number and enter the domain of text. Such times we shall have! What sights we shall see! (And what terrors lie within?)

Strings are an interesting case. R uses a single data type to represent strings (character vectors) but Arrow has two types, known as strings and large strings. When using the **arrow** package, Arrow strings are specified using the `utf8()` function, and large strings correspond to the `large_utf8()` type. The default mapping is to assume that an R character vector maps onto the Arrow `utf8()` type, as shown below:

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Default mappings for character types"
knitr::include_graphics("img/character-types.png", dpi = 100)
```

There's a little more than meets the eye here though, and you might be wondering about the difference between "strings" and "large strings" in Arrow, and when you might prefer one to the other. As you might expect, the large string type is suitable when you're storing large amounts of text, but to understand it properly I need to talk in more depth about how R and Arrow store strings, and I'll use this partial list of people that -- according to the lyrics of [Jung Talent Time](https://genius.com/Tism-jung-talent-time-lyrics) by TISM -- were perhaps granted slightly more fame than they had earned on merit

```
Bert Newton
Billy Ray Cyrus
Warwick Capper
Uri Geller
Samantha Fox
```

### [R] The character class

Suppose I want to store this as a character vector in R, storing only the family names for the sake of brevity and visual clarity. 

```{r}
jung_talent <- c("Newton", "Cyrus", "Capper", "Geller", "Fox")
```

Each element of the `jung_talent` vector is a variable-length string, and is stored internally by R as an array of individual characters^[As noted in the R internals manual, the specific data structure is referred to as a [CHARSXP](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#Encodings-for-CHARSXPs). For the purposes of the current post I'm pretending that character strings are always encoded as UTF-8 because there's no need to complicate matters by talking about things like Latin-1, but be aware that R does support those things. If you're looking for a good overview of what UTF-8 encoding is all about, this blog post on [how unicode works](https://deliciousbrains.com/how-unicode-works/) is helpful.] So, to a first approximation, your mental model of how R stores the `jung_talent` variable might look something like this:

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Simplified representation of how character vectors are represented in R"
knitr::include_graphics("img/character-types-02.png", dpi = 100)
```

Here, the `jung_talent` variable is an object^[More strictly, it is a symbol that points to an object. R makes a distinction between the symbol and the object to which it links, and allows multiple labels to point at the same object. There's an excellent discussion of this in [Chapter 3 of Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/names-values.html)] that contains five elements shown as the orange boxes. Internally, each of those orange boxes is itself an array of individual characters shown as the purple boxes. As a description of what R actually does this is a bit of an oversimplification because it ignores the [global string pool](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/names-values.html#character-vectors), but it will be sufficient for the current purposes. 

The key thing to understand conceptually is that R treats the elements of a character vector as the fundamental unit. The `jung_talent` vector is constructed from five distinct strings, `"Newton"`, `"Cyrus"`, etc. The `"Newton"` string is assigned to position 1, the `"Cyrus"` string is assigned to position 2, and so on. 

### [Arrow] The utf8 type

The approach taken in Arrow is rather different. Instead of carving up the character vector into strings (and internally treating the strings as character arrays), it concatenates everything into one long buffer. The text itself is dumped into one long string, like this:

```
NewtonCyrusCapperGellerFox
```

The first element of this buffer -- the letter `"N"` -- is stored at "offset 0" (indexing in Arrow starts at 0), the second element is stored at offset 1, and so on. This long array of text is referred to as the data buffer, and it does not specify where the boundaries between array elements are. Those are stored separately. If I were to create an Arrow string array called `jung_talent_arrow`, it would be comprised of a data buffer, and an "offset buffer" that specifies the positions at which each element of the string array begins. In other words, we'd have a mental model that looks a bit like this:

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Simplified representation of how character vectors are represented in Arrow"
knitr::include_graphics("img/character-types-03.png", dpi = 150)
```

How are each of these buffers encoded?

- The contents of the data buffer are stored as UTF-8 text, which is itself a variable length encoding: some characters are encoded using only 8 bits while others require 32 bits. This [blog post on unicode](https://deliciousbrains.com/how-unicode-works/) is a nice explainer.

- The contents of the offset buffer are stored as unsigned integers, either 32 bit or 64 bit, depending on which of the two Arrow string array types you're using. I'll unpack this in the next section.

Sheesh. That was long. Let's give ourselves a small round of applause for surviving, and now actually *do* something. We'll port the `jung_talent` vector over to Arrow. 

```{r}
jung_talent_arrow <- chunked_array(jung_talent)
jung_talent_arrow
```

That certainly looks like text to me! Let's take a look at the data type:

```{r}
jung_talent_arrow$type
```

Yep. Definitely text! 

### [Arrow] The large_utf8 type

Okay, so as I mentioned, Arrow has two different string types: utf8 and large_utf8.^[Once again, there's a little terminology to explain because there's some inconsistency in how the types are referred to in the Arrow C++ documentation and the **arrow** R package documentation. In the [list of data types](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/datatype.html) for the underlying C++ library you'll find references to "string" types and "large_string". However, in [list of data types](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/data-type.html) documentation for the **arrow** R package you'll see the same data types referred to as "utf8" and "large_utf8".] The default in **arrow** is to translate character data in R to the utf8 data type in Arrow, but we can override this if we want to. In order to help you make an informed choice, I'll dig a little deeper into the difference between the two types.

The first thing to recognise is that the nature of the data buffer is the same for utf8 and large_utf8: the difference between the two lies in how the offset buffers are encoded. When character data are encoded as utf8 type, every offset value is stored as an unsigned 32-bit integer. That means that -- as shown in the table of integer types earlier in the post -- you cannot store an offset value larger than 4294967295. This constrain places a practical cap on the total length of the data buffer: if total amount of text stored in the data buffer is greater than about 2GiB, the offset buffer can't encode the locations within it! Switching to large_utf8 means that the offset buffer will store every offset value as an unsigned 64-bit integer. This means that the offset buffer now takes up twice as much space, but it allows you to encode offset values up to... um... 18446744073709551615. And if you've got so much text that your data buffer is going to exceed that limit, well, frankly you have bigger problems. 

In short, if you're not going to exceed 2GiB of text in your array, you don't need large_utf8. Once you start getting near that limit, you might want to think about switching:

```{r}
jung_talent_arrow_big <- chunked_array(jung_talent, type = large_utf8())
jung_talent_arrow_big$type
```

Before moving on, I'll mention one additional complexity. This is a situation where the distinction between arrays and chunked arrays begins to matter. Strictly speaking, I lied earlier when I said there's only one data buffer. A more precise statement would be to say that there is one data buffer per *chunk*. Chunked arrays are designed to allow a block (or "chunk") of contiguous rows in a table to be stored together in a single location (or file). There are good reasons for doing that^[No I am not going to talk about them in this post I am not *that* much of a masochist. You will have to wait for a later post!], but they aren't immediately relevant. What matters is to recognise that in a chunked array, the 2GiB limit on utf8 type data applies on a per-chunk basis.  

## Date/time types

<!--
TODO
Quine has a smartarse quote about time being lingustically special
-->


Next up on our tour of data types are dates and times. Internally, R and Arrow both adopt the convention of measuring time in terms of the time elapsed since a specific moment in time known as the [unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). The unix epoch is the time 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970. It was a Thursday.

Despite agreeing on fundamentals, there are some oddities in the particulars. Base R has three date/time classes (Date, POSIXct, and POSIXlt), and while Arrow also has three date/time classes (date32, date64, and timestamp), the default mappings between them are a little puzzling unless you are deeply familiar with what all these data types are and what they represent. I'll do the deep dive in a moment, but to give you the big picture here's how the mapping works:

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Default mappings for date/time types"
knitr::include_graphics("img/date-types.png", dpi = 100)
```


### [R] The Date class

On the R side of things, a Date object is represented internally as a numeric value, counting the number of days since the unix epoch. Here is today as a Date:

```{r}
today <- Sys.Date()
today
```

If I use `unclass()` to see what it looks like under the hood:

```{r}
unclass(today)
```

Fundamentally, a Date object is just a number: it counts the number of days that have elapsed since a fixed date. It does not care what the year is, what the month is, or what day of the month it is. It does not care how the date is displayed to the user. All those things are supplied by the `print()` method, and are not part of the Date itself.

### [R] The POSIXct class

A date is a comparatively simple thing. When we want to represent dates and time together, we nee we need to know the time of day, and we might need to store information about the timezone as well (more on that later). Base R has two different classes for representing this, POSIXct and POSIXlt. These names used to confuse me a lot. [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) stands for "portable operating system interface", and it's a set of standards used to help operating systems remain compatible with each other. In this context though, it's not very meaningful: all it says "yup we use unix time." 

The more important part of the name is actually the ["ct" versus "lt"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44778721/what-do-ct-and-lt-in-posixct-and-posixlt-mean) part. Let's start with POSIXct. The "ct" in POSIXct stands for "calendar time": internally, R stores the number of seconds that have elapsed since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC.

```{r}
now <- Sys.time()
now
```

If I peek under the hood using `unclass()` here's what I see:

```{r}
unclass(now)
```

There are no attributes attached to this object, it is simply a count of the number of seconds since that particular moment in time. However, it doesn't necessarily have to be this way: a POSIXct object is permitted to have a "tzone" attribute, a character string that specifies the timezone that is used when printing the object will be preserved when it is converted to a POSIXlt.

Nevertheless, when I created the `now` object by calling `Sys.time()`, no timezone information was stored in the object. The fact that it appears when I print out `now` occurs because the `print()` method for POSIXct objects prints the time with respect to a particular timezone. The default is to use the system timezone, which you can check by calling `Sys.timezone()`, but you can override this behaviour by specifying the timezone explicitly (for a list of timezone names, see `OlsonNames()`). So if I wanted to print the time in Berlin, I could do this:

```{r}
print(now, tz = "Europe/Berlin")
```

If you want to record the timezone as part of your POSIXct object rather than relying on the print method to do the work, you can do so by setting the `tzone` attribute. To illustrate this, let's pretend I'm in Tokyo:

```{r}
attr(now, "tzone") <- "Asia/Tokyo"
now
```

The important thing here is that the timezone is metadata used to change the how the time is displayed. Changing the timezone does not alter the number of seconds stored in the `now` object:

```{r}
unclass(now)
```

### [R] The POSIXlt class

What about POSIXlt? It turns out that this is a quite different kind of data structure, and it "thinks" about time in a very different way. The "lt" in POSIXlt stands for "local time", and internally a POSIXlt object is a list that stores information about the time in a way that more closely mirrors how humans think about it. Here's what `now` looks like when I coerce it to a POSIXlt object:

```{r}
now_lt <- as.POSIXlt(now)
now_lt
```

It *looks* the same, but this is an illusion produced by the `print()` method. Internally, the `now_lt` object is a very different kind of thing. To see this, lets see what happens if we print it as if it were a regular list:

```{r}
unclass(now_lt)
```

As you can see, this object separately stores the year (counted from 1900), the month (where January is month 0 and December is month 11), the day of the month (starting at day 1), etc.^[A little counterintuitively, the value of `sec` ranges from 0 to 61, presumably because [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) are a thing. I am *not* going to torture myself with that one today.] The timezone is stored, as is the day of the week (Sunday is day 0), it specifies whether daylight savings time is in effect, and so on. Time, as represented in the POSIXlt class, uses a collection of categories that are approximately the same as those that humans use when we talk about time. 

It is not a compact representation, and it's useful for quite different things than POSIXct. What matters for the current purposes is that POSIXlt is, fundamentally, a list structure, and is not in any sense a "timestamp".


### [Arrow] The date32 type

Okay, now let's pivot over to the Arrow side and see what we have to work with. The date32 type is similar -- but not identical -- to the R Date class. Just like the R Date class, it counts the number of days since 1970-01-01. To see this, let's create an analog of the `today` Date object inside Arrow, and represent it as a date32 type:

```{r}
today_date32 <- scalar(today, type = date32())
today_date32
```

We can expose the internal structure of this object by casting it to an integer:

```{r}
today_date32$cast(int32())
```

This is the same answer we got earlier when I used `unclass()` to take a peek at the internals of the `today` object. That being said, there is a subtle difference: in Arrow, the date32 type is explicitly a 32-bit integer. If you read through the help documentation for date/time classes in R you'll see that R has something a little more complicated going on. The details don't matter for this post, but you should be aware that Dates (and POSIXct objects) are stored as doubles. Unlike Arrow, they aren't stored as integers:

```{r, results='hold'}
typeof(today)
typeof(now)
```

In any case, given that the Arrow date32 type and the R Date class are so similar to each other in structure and intended usage, it is natural to map R Dates to Arrow date32 types and vice versa, and that's what the **arrow** package does by default. 

### [Arrow] The date64 type

The date64 type is similar to the date32 type, but instead of storing the number of days since 1970-01-01 as a 32-bit integer, it stores the number of milliseconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC as a 64-bit integer. It's similar to the POSIXct class in R, except that (1) it uses milliseconds instead of seconds; (2) the internal storage is a 64-bit integer, not a 32-bit double; and (3) it does not have metadata and cannot represent timezones.

As you might have guessed, the date64 type in Arrow isn't very similar to the Date class in R. Because it represents time at the millisecond level, the intended use of the date64 class is in situations where you want to keep track of units of time smaller than one day. Sure, I *can* create date64 objects from R Date objects if I want to...

```{r}
scalar(today, date64())
```

...but this is quite wasteful. Why use a 64-bit representation that tracks time at the millisecond level when all I'm doing is storing the date? Although POSIXct and date64 aren't exact matches, they're more closely related to each other than Date and date64. So let's create an Arrow analog of `now` as a date64 object:

```{r}
now_date64 <- scalar(now, date64())
now_date64
```

The output is *printed* as a date, but it is a little bit misleading because it doesn't give you a good sense of the level of precision in the data. Again we can peek under the hood by explicitly casting this to a 64-bit integer:

```{r}
now_date64$cast(int64())
```

This isn't a count of the number of days since the unix epoch, it's a count of the number of milliseconds. It is essentially the same number, divided by 1000, as the one we obtained when I typed `unclass(now)`. However, there's a puzzle here that we need to solve. Let's take another look at `unclass(now)`:

```{r}
unclass(now)
```

This might strike you as very weird. On the face of it, what has happened is that I have taken `now` (which ostensibly represents time at "second-level" precision), ported it over to Arrow, and created an object `now_date64` that apparently knows what millisecond it is???? How is that possible? Does Arrow have magic powers? 

Not really. R is playing tricks here. Remember how I said that POSIXct objects are secretly doubles and not integers? Well, this is where that becomes relevant. It's quite hard to get R to confess that a POSIXct object actually knows the time at a more precise level than "to the nearest second" but you can get it do to so by coercing it to a POSIXlt object and then taking a peek at the `sec` variable:

```{r}
as.POSIXlt(now)$sec
```

Aha! The first few digits of the decimal expansion are the same ones stored as the least significant digits in `now_date64`. The data was there all along. Even though `unclass(now)` produces an output that has been rounded to the nearest second, the original `now` variable is indeed a double, and it *does* store the time a higher precision! Ultimately, the accuracy of the time depends on the system clock itself, but the key thing to not here is that even though POSIXct times are almost always displayed to the nearest second, they do have the ability to represent more precise times. 

Because of this, the default behaviour in **arrow** is to convert date64 types (64-bit integers interpreted as counts of milliseconds) to POSIXct classes (which are secretly 32-bit doubles interpreted as counts of seconds). 

Right. Moving on.

### [Arrow] The timestamp type

The last of the Arrow date/time types is the timestamp. The core data structure is a 64-bit integer used to count the number of time units that have passed since the unix epoch, and this is associated with two additional pieces of metadata: the time unit used (e.g., "seconds", "milliseconds, "microseconds", "nanoseconds"), and the timezone. As with the POSIXct class in R, the timezone metadata is optional, but the time unit is necessary. The default is to use microseconds (i.e., `unit = "us"`):

```{r, results='hold'}
scalar(now)
scalar(now, timestamp(unit = "us"))
```

Alternatively, we could use seconds:

```{r}
scalar(now, timestamp(unit = "s"))
```

It's important to recognise that changing the unit does more than change the precision at which the timestamp is printed. It changes "the thing that is counted", so the numbers that get stored in the timestamp are quite different depending on the unit. Compare the numbers that are stored when the units are seconds versus when the units are nanoseconds:

```{r, results='hold'}
scalar(now, timestamp(unit = "s"))$cast(int64())
scalar(now, timestamp(unit = "ns"))$cast(int64())
```

Okay, what about timezone. Recall that `now` has a timezone attached to it, because I explicitly recorded the `tzone` attribute earlier. Admittedly I lied and I said I was in Tokyo and not in Sydney, but still, that information is in the `now` object:

```{r}
now
```

When I print the R object it displays the time in the relevant time zone. The output for the Arrow object doesn't do that: the time *as displayed* is shown in UTC. However, that doesn't mean that the metadata isn't there:

```{r}
now_timestamp <- scalar(now)
now_timestamp$type
```

I mention this because this caused me a considerable amount of panic at one point when I thought my timezone information had been lost when importing data from POSIXct into Arrow. Nothing was lost, it is simply that the **arrow** R package prints all timestamps in the corresponding UTC time regardless of what timezone is specified in the metadata. 

There is, however, a catch. This worked last time *because* I was diligent and ensured that my `now` variable encoded the timezone. By default, a POSIXct object created by `Sys.time()` will not include the timezone. It's easy to forget this because the `print()` method for POSIXct objects will inspect the system timezone if the POSIXct object doesn't contain any timezone information, so it can often *look* like you have a timezone stored in your POSIXct object when actually you don't. When that happens, Arrow can't help you. Because the POSIXct object does not have a timezone (all appearances to the contrary), the object that arrives in Arrow won't have a timezone either. Here's what I mean:

```{r}
# a POSIXct object with no timezone
new_now <- Sys.time() # has no time zone...
new_now               # ... but appears to!

# an Arrow timestamp with no timezone
new_now_timestamp <- scalar(new_now)
new_now_timestamp$type
```

The take-home message in all this is that if you're going to be working in both Arrow and R, and using the **arrow** package for data interchange, you'd be well advised to be careful with your POSIXct objects and timezones. They are trickier than they look, and can lead to subtle translation errors if you are not careful! 

### Um, but what about POSIXlt?

At long last we come to POSIXlt, which has no clear analog in Arrow. The key idea behind POSIXlt is to represent temporal information in terms of multiple different units: days, weeks, years, seconds, timezones, and so on. It's a very different kind of thing to a POSIXct object in R or a timestamp in Arrow. In R terms, it's essentially a list, and as a consequence the default behaviour in **arrow** is to import it as a struct (which serves essentially the same purpose). Here's how that looks:

```{r}
scalar(now_lt)
```

The struct object contains named fields that are identical to their POSIXlt equivalents, and whose types have been translated according to the default mappings: `sec` is a double, `min` is an int32, `hour` is an int32, `zone` is a string, and so on.

This arrangement, where POSIXct maps to timestamp and POSIXlt maps to struct, makes perfect sense when you think about the underlying data structures that POSIXct and POSIXlt encode. Where things can be tricky for the R user is in the "mental account keeping". In order to be helpful, R displays POSIXct and POSIXlt objects in exactly the same way:

```{r, results='hold'}
now
now_lt
```

Not only that, because POSIXct and POSIXlt are both subclasses of the POSIXt class, R allows you to perform temporal arithmetic on objects of different types:

```{r}
now - now_lt
```

This is very convenient from a data analysis perspective, since calculations performed with date/time classes "just work" even though POSIXct objects are secretly doubles and POSIXlt objects are secretly lists. However, all this happens invisibly. In much the same way that it's easy to forget that POSIXct objects may not encode a timezone even though they *look* like they do, it can be easy to forget that POSIXct and POSIXlt are fundamentally different objects, and they map onto quite different data structures in Arrow. 

## Duration types

Any discussion of temporal data is incomplete without a discussion of duration types, which are used to describe a length of time without reference to any fixed origin. The figure below shows the default mappings used by **arrow**:

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.cap = "Default mappings for duration types"
knitr::include_graphics("img/duration-types.png", dpi = 100)
```


### [R] The difftime class

In base R, the difference between two date/time objects is stored as a difftime object. To give a better illustration of a difftime object, let's create `diff`, a variable that stores the amount of time elapsed between executing the R markdown chunk that first computed the `now` variable, and executing the R markdown chunk below:

```{r}
new_now <- Sys.time()
rmd_time <- new_now - now
rmd_time
```

Now let's take a look at how it's actually stored:

```{r}
unclass(rmd_time)
```

The duration is represented as a numeric variable, and the `"units"` attribute is used to specify the time unit that it represents: "secs", "mins", "hours", "days" or "weeks". Unless the user specifies exactly which unit is to be used, R will attempt to make a sensible choice. For instance, if I were to do this,

```{r}
hedy_lamarr <- as.POSIXct("1914-11-09 19:30:00", tz = "Europe/Vienna")
hedy_age <- now - hedy_lamarr
hedy_age
```

I would learn that it has been `r round(c(hedy_age))` days since [Hedy Lamarr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr) was born.^[Yes, I looked up her [time and location of birth](https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Lamarr,_Hedy) on an astrology website. I am, after all, a queer. It is one of the traditions of our people.] More to the point, R has guessed that the length of time is sufficiently long that seconds aren't the appropriate encoding unit:

```{r}
unclass(hedy_age)
```

### [Arrow] The duration type

The difftime class in R has a natural analog in Arrow, the duration type. As usual though, they are not *exactly* equivalent to one another. An R difftime object stores the value as a double, so it has no problems storing `r round(rmd_time, 2)` as the value and setting the units to be seconds. This doesn't work very well in Arrow because the value is stored as a signed 64 bit integer (int64), and a value of `r round(rmd_time, 2)` seconds will simply round down to a duration of zero seconds. When importing my duration data into Arrow, then, I should be careful to ensure I choose a higher precision unit. If I don't, things can go a little awry:

```{r}
rmd_time_arrow <- scalar(rmd_time)
rmd_time_arrow
```

Hm. Zero seconds was not exactly the answer I was looking for. It helps a little to take a peek at the data type and see what precisely it is that I have just created: 

```{r}
rmd_time_arrow$type
```

This reveals my mistake. I've encoded the time rounded to the nearest second, which is not very useful in this instance. What I really should have done is specify a higher level of precision. To import a duration into Arrow rounded to the nearest microsecond, I can do this:

```{r}
rmd_time_arrow <- scalar(rmd_time, duration(unit = "us"))
rmd_time_arrow
```

That's a little better! Again, I can inspect the data type and see that the unit of encoding is now set to microseconds:

```{r}
rmd_time_arrow$type
```


### [R] The hms::hms class

So where are we up to in our voyage through the world of dates, times, and durations in the R world? We've talked about situations where you can specify a fixed date (with the Date class) and situations where you can specify a fixed moment in time (with POSIXct and POSIXlt classes). We've also talked about situations where you can specify an amount of time without fixing it to a specific date or time (with the difftime class). What we haven't talked about is how to store the time of day. In base R you can talk about a date without needing to specify a time, or you can talk about times and dates together, but what you can't do is specify a time on its own without a date. 

The **hms** package fixes this by supplying the hms class. Internally, it's just a difftime object that counts the number of seconds elapsed since midnight. As I type these words the current time is 14:05:25, and I could create an hms object representing this like so:

```{r}
hms_time <- hms::hms(seconds = 25, minutes = 5, hours = 14)
hms_time
```

The nice thing about hms times is that they inherit from difftime, which we can see by checking the class vector for our `hms_time` object

```{r}
class(hms_time)
```

Just to show that there really isn't anything fancy going on, let's strip the class attribute away and let R print out the raw object. As the output here shows, an hms object has the same underlying structure as a regular difftime object:

```{r}
unclass(hms_time)
```

### [Arrow] The time32 and time64 types

What about Arrow? 

At a technical level, it would be perfectly possible to translate an hms object in R into an Arrow duration object, but that feels slightly unnatural. The entire reason why the hms class exists in R is that we -- the human users -- attach special meaning to the "duration of time that has elapsed since midnight on an arbitrary day". We call it the time of day, and while technically it is possible to represent the time of day as a duration (or an hms as a difftime), human beings like to treat special things as special for a reason. 

Because of this, Arrow supplies two data types that are roughly analogous to the hms class in R, called time32 and time64. The time32 type stores the time of day as a signed 32-bit integer, which represents the number of seconds (or alternatively, milliseconds) since midnight. By default, the **arrow** package will translate an hms object to a time32 type, using seconds as the unit:

```{r}
hms_time32_s <- scalar(hms_time)
hms_time32_s
```

As usual, let's just verify that the encoding unit is as expected:

```{r}
hms_time32_s$type
```

Yep, we're all good! To switch to milliseconds, I would use a command like this:

```{r}
hms_time32_ms <- scalar(hms_time, time32(unit = "ms"))
hms_time32_ms
```

Notice that the output shows the time in a little more resolution. I find this a helpful touch, since it provides a visual cue letting me know what the unit is. But just to confirm, let's inspect the type explicitly:

```{r}
hms_time32_ms$type
```

If you need to represent the time of day at a higher degree of precision, you'll want to use the time64 type, which (shockingly!) represents the time of day as a signed 64-bit integer. When using the time64 class you can choose microseconds (`unit = "us"`) or nanoseconds (the default, `unit = "ns"`) as the unit:

```{r}
hms_time64_us <- scalar(hms_time, time64())
hms_time64_us
```

The display is showing more trailing zeros, so you can already be sure that the encoding unit has changed. So the only real question you might have pertains to the author. Will she be tediously predictable and check the data type yet again to verify that the encoding unit is nanoseconds, just like she has done every time before? Yes. Yes she will:

```{r}
hms_time64_us$type
```

She is quite tiresome at times.

In essence, the **arrow** defaults are set up such that if you choose `time32()` when going from R to Arrow without specifying a unit, you will end up with the lowest precision representation of time (rounded to the nearest second), whereas if you do the same with `time64()` you end up with the highest precision (nanosecond level) representation. When going the other way, **arrow** will map time32 types and time64 types to hms objects, and the end result is that the time of day will be stored as a 32-bit double. 

## Other types

As with any story told by humans, this one is incomplete. When I started writing this post I had the ambition to cover every single line in the [Table of R/Arrow mappings](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/arrow.html#mapping-of-r-arrow-types) shown in the **arrow** documentation. I didn't quite get there in the end, and there are a few missing cases. I'll briefly mention them here:

- Arrow possesses a "null" value used to represent missing data, and behaves similarly to `NA` in R. In base R there are several different `NA` values, corresponding to the different atomic types: `NA_logical`, `NA_character`. The way this is handled in **arrow** is to rely on the **vctrs** package. Specifically, in **vctrs** there is a "vctrs_unspecified" class that works very well here, so Arrow nulls map to vctrs_unspecified and vice versa. In practice, this is where `NA` values enter into the picture.

- In R there is the concept of the "raw" type used to represent bytes. Arrow doesn't have a natural equivalent of this, but the closest is an unsigned 8-bit integer, so the default is to map raw to uint8.

- I haven't talked about factors at all, and frankly I probably should have. My only excuse is exhaustion. The post was getting very long and I ran out of energy. The analog of factors in Arrow is the "dictionary" type. They're not exact mirrors of each other so it's worth reading the documentation, but it's close enough that factors are mapped to dictionaries and vice versa. 

- R and Arrow both allow more complicated data structures to be included as columns within a data frame (or table). For example, in R each element of a column can itself be a data frame. In such cases, the default in **arrow** is to map each R data frame onto an Arrow struct. Again, this is one where it's worth reading the documentation, because there are some subtleties with how things like list columns are handled.
