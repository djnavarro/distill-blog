checklist:
  - check the "update me" messages in YAML above
  - initialise the _renv folder with refinery::renv_new("name of post folder")
  - populate the lockfile with refinery::renv_snapshot("name of post folder")
  - update the _renv folder from snapshot with refinery::restore("name of post folder")

<!--------------- setup post ----------------->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# let's skip full refinery process...
#refinery::renv_load(paste(params$date, params$slug, sep = "_"))

# instead... here's the snapshot command:
postname <- paste(params$date, params$slug, sep = "_")
refinery::renv_snapshot(postname)

# and here's the renv::use
renv::use(lockfile = here::here("_renv", "_posts", postname, "renv.lock"))
```


<!--------------- post ----------------->

Leaving academia is rarely a simple or unemotional decision, no matter what career stage you are at, no matter where you're headed to next, or whether you're leaving by choice. In ways that are both good and bad, the academic life is quite different to working in industry, so you are necessarily taking a jump into the unknown. I don't believe anyone can make those kinds of changes without experiencing fear, and I think anyone who attempts a transition of this kind deserves support in their choice. 

I made the jump this year, in 2022, effectively ending an academic career that began when I started my PhD in 1999. I've been in my new role for almost three months now, long enough to have a few thoughts about my new world. It's also been long enough that friends and twitter followers have been asking if I could share my experiences. I've spoken to a few people privately, but sometimes it helps to put thoughts into writing. 

With that in mind, this post is my attempt to provide a little love, support, and maybe even a little help to others who are in a similar situation to the one I was in. It's intended as both a personal and practical comment: I'll mix some practical suggestions with thoughts on the emotional and psychological aspects to the transition.

## Abandon "prestige", ye that enter here

If you have been in academia long enough you will have an internalised a core concept that you need to abandon: *prestige*. Academia runs on prestige, and everyone on the inside understands in our bones how important this particular currency is. Where you publish, where you study, who you work with, what "tier" your institution belongs to, these things are utterly irrelevant to your value as a human being or your skills as an employee, and yet in many ways they are more important to your career success than oh, say... the actual work you do. Not for nothing do we joke that the fundamental dogma of academia is "Nothing in academia makes sense except in light of prestige". Prestige is the reason I published a disproportionate number of my papers in *Psychological Review*. It's the reason I would accidentally-on-purpose let "slip" that I was on the editorial board at *Science* when I needed to impress someone quickly. Prestige. It matters.

Except, no-one outside the academy cares. Not even a little bit. The peculiar currency of academia has no meaning in the outside world. That's sad, but I have good news: 

In industry, we use _money_ as currency instead. 

It's a frighteningly novel concept for an institutionalised academic, but one you might come to love, so I'll unpack this is a bit. Because it _doesn't_ mean you'll necessarily be paid more (though you might). Rather, what it means is that it is you are performing a service in exchange for money. The company buys your time and your work; it doesn't buy your soul. Not only that, a _good_ company understands this, and would never dream of trying to take it away from you. You don't have to personalise the work any more. You don't have to hold it dear to your heart as if your employment contract were proof of your value as a person. That concept of "prestige" you're secretly holding onto? That's one of those mechanisms by which academia ties your sense of self-worth to little "badges" of achievement and doesn't even pay you for the work. How much work have you given away for free, to third parties who make a profit of your work? For no reason other than "prestige"?

You can let that all go now. It will hurt to let it go, because -- so much more than your junior colleagues who got out when they were young -- you have become invested in it and the hooks are laid much deeper in your psyche. But you can, and it's surprisingly liberating when it happens.

## Your resume is an advertisement for you

> It's a flyer, not a monograph

## It's speed dating, not a courtship

For junior academics, applying for positions is often a numbers game: finding that first academic appointment involves a lot of applications, a lot of rejections, and a lot of anxiety. For senior academics, however, the process is different. There's not really a "job market" in the traditional sense, just a loose network of relationships that you can use to "put out feelers" and surreptitiously negotiate a move if a mutually agreeable arrangement is possible. In many ways it is a courtship, involving many trips, back and forths, and evolves over a long time frame, and eventually culminates in a proposal of marriage (or tenured professorship). 

Prepare for some culture shock!


## Don't play fair when the deck is stacked

> You're at a disadvantage. So use whatever secret weapons you have. Shamelessly. Everyone else will be doing something similar anyway

## Negotiation?

Look, you already know the situation here. 

## Welcome to the new world, we have tiny cakes

Arrival is hard. Who are devops and what are they even for? How does anything work at this mad time scale anyway?
