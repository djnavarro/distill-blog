checklist:
  - check the "update me" messages in YAML above
  - initialise the _renv folder with refinery::renv_new("name of post folder")
  - populate the lockfile with refinery::renv_snapshot("name of post folder")
  - update the _renv folder from snapshot with refinery::restore("name of post folder")

---->


<!--------------- setup post ----------------->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# let's skip full refinery process...
#refinery::renv_load(paste(params$date, params$slug, sep = "_"))

# instead... here's the snapshot command:
postname <- paste(params$date, params$slug, sep = "_")
refinery::renv_snapshot(postname)

# and here's the renv::use
renv::use(lockfile = here::here("_renv", "_posts", postname, "renv.lock"))
```


<!--------------- post ----------------->

Leaving academia is rarely a simple or unemotional decision, no matter what career stage you are at, no matter where you're headed to next, or whether you're leaving by choice. In ways that are both good and bad, the academic life is quite different to working in industry, so you are necessarily taking a jump into the unknown. I don't believe anyone can make those kinds of changes without experiencing fear, and I think anyone who attempts a transition of this kind deserves support in their choice. 

I made the jump this year, in 2022, effectively ending an academic career that began when I started my PhD in 1999. I've been in my new role for almost three months now, long enough to have a few thoughts about my new world. It's also been long enough that friends and twitter followers have been asking if I could share my experiences. I've spoken to a few people privately, but sometimes it helps to put thoughts into writing. 

With that in mind, this post is my attempt to provide a little love, support, and maybe even a little help to others who are in a similar situation to the one I was in. It's intended as both a personal and practical comment: I'll mix some practical suggestions with thoughts on the emotional and psychological aspects to the transition.

## Do the reading, but like... just one book?

If you're reading my blog post specifically, there's a pretty good chance that you're thinking about a career in the tech sector, and probably in data science specifically. This makes a lot of sense for you. You already have most of the core skills required to be a data scientist. You can code, you can analyse data, you can communicate well. You can manage projects, you can work in teams and individually, you've probably had experience managing and supervising junior scientists and analysts. 

What you _don't_ have is industry experience. You aren't quite sure what that world is going to be like and exactly how to recast the skills you have in language that folks over in industry land will understand. What you need is a book that helps you understand the lay of the land, and I am _absolutely not going to write that book_. What I am going to do instead, is mention that [Emily Robinson](https://twitter.com/robinson_es) and [Jacqueline Nolis](https://twitter.com/skyetetra) already did. Their book is called [*Build a Career in Data Science*](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-career-in-data-science) and it's very good. It's the book I used to help me out, and instead of repeating their advice I will simply recommend it to you.

If you really want to I guess you could read more, but the whole concept of "doing _all_ the reading" is one of those things you can let go of. Even if you find a different book, just read one book okay? You're even allowed to skim. Be honest: that's what you were doing already, just like everyone else in academia.

The only note of caution I would add, if you're an established academic looking to make the jump, is that academic folks like us aren't the primary audience for the book. It's a more general book and doesn't talk much (or at all) about the peculiarities associated with the academia-to-industry transition. You'll need to do a little bit of translation to make it applicable to you. That's okay though, because you're very good at this kind of mental athletics: academia has trained you for it! Still, when chatting with Emily and Jacqueline in order to say thanks for their book, I did mention that I wished someone had written a translated version of the book for academics looking to get out. 

No, I'm not going to write *that* book either. As a consolation prize you get this blog post.

## Abandon "prestige", ye that enter here

If you have been in academia long enough you will have an internalised a core concept that you need to abandon: *prestige*. Academia runs on prestige, and everyone on the inside understands in our bones how important this particular currency is. Where you publish, where you study, who you work with, what "tier" your institution belongs to, these things are utterly irrelevant to your value as a human being or your skills as an employee, and yet in many ways they are more important to your career success than oh, say... the actual work you do. Not for nothing do we joke that the fundamental dogma of academia is "Nothing in academia makes sense except in light of prestige". Prestige is the reason I published a disproportionate number of my papers in *Psychological Review*. It's the reason I would accidentally-on-purpose let "slip" that I was on the editorial board at *Science* when I needed to impress someone quickly. Prestige. It matters.

Except, no-one outside the academy cares. Not even a little bit. The peculiar currency of academia has no meaning in the outside world. That's sad, but I have good news: 

In industry, we use _money_ as currency instead. 

It's a frighteningly novel concept for an institutionalised academic, but one you might come to love, so I'll unpack this is a bit. Because it _doesn't_ mean you'll necessarily be paid more (though you might). Rather, what it means is that it is you are performing a service in exchange for money. The company buys your time and your work; it doesn't buy your soul. Not only that, a _good_ company understands this, and would never dream of trying to take it away from you. You don't have to personalise the work any more. You don't have to hold it dear to your heart as if your employment contract were proof of your value as a person. That concept of "prestige" you're secretly holding onto? That's one of those mechanisms by which academia ties your sense of self-worth to little "badges" of achievement and doesn't even pay you for the work. How much work have you given away for free, to third parties who make a profit of your work? For no reason other than "prestige"?

You can let that all go now. It will hurt to let it go, because -- so much more than your junior colleagues who got out when they were young -- you have become invested in it and the hooks are laid much deeper in your psyche. But you can, and it's surprisingly liberating when it happens.

## Your résumé is an advertisement for you

From the moment we enter the system, there is a piece of advice we're given: keep track of everything. Every talk, every paper, every book, every prize, every award, every compliment from student. All these things must be stored, collated, reused, organised, and *used*. They are the evidence we use for our promotion applications, our grant applications, our various pleas and supplications to the dark gods of the ivory tower. And so it is that every academic CV becomes a monstrosity, a log file listing every activity from which value can be extracted. It is time to let that all go. Breathe, darling. 

### Your résumé is an advertisement...

The vast, vast majority of your CV is not necessary any longer, because the fundamental purpose of the résumé has changed. It is not a testament to your worth. It is not a log of your achievements. It is not in any meaningful sense *documentation*, and it is certainly not a store of value. It is an advertisement that you place with a company, to catch their attention:

> Your résumé is a flyer. It is not a monograph

If you are at all like me this is a very hard concept to get used to. Frantic, I would ask myself how I could possibly reduce all my self-worth and my value to the company to a mere page? It simply cannot be done! 

Of course it can't. That's *not* the task at hand. Your CV bears no relationship to your value as a person, and its *only* function is to convince the right company to give you an interview. (Note that I say "the right company"... gonna come back to that!)

Yes fine, Danielle, I hear you say. But how do I do this? It's a big conceptual shift and I don't even know where to start the process. Worry not, beloved reader, for just this once (never again, I promise!) I have practical guidance for you. 

No really. 

I do.

Very practical. 

Stop laughing. 

...I hate you. 

Okay, now that we've got that out of our system, let's get started. In an act of personal catharsis I destroyed most of the evidence that I was ever a fully institutionalised academic, so I no longer own any of my old "proper" academic CVs, but you don't have to look too hard to discover evidence that I used to have one:

- Behold the [list of my publications and despair!](https://djnavarro.net/papers) 
- Tremble before [my h-index and my citation count!](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=QPH_lRIAAAAJ&hl=en)^[Yeah, I'm currently dating an obnoxiously competent computational biologist, and her citation count *for last year* is perilously close to doubling my citation count for my entire career. I've given up on any illusion that my citations are even slightly impressive. I am very much the Kardashian of this relationship. That is *so* not the point!]
- Embrace the visual horror of my [ORCID profile!](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7648-6578)

Once upon a time I had a document that included all these things, tracked all the journal impact factors associated with every publication, listed every grant, every research contract, every... oh, you know. You have one of these too. It's probably 50 pages long or something.

Your first task is to strip that back to **two pages**. You don't have to reformat it at all. It's still an academic CV. What I'm asking you to do in this first step is to find a way of condensing the things you actually care about in academia into a manageable format. You don't have to think like an industry person at all yet. Just imagine a crazy world in which academics didn't have to write monographs just to get permission to use the bloody bathroom, and choose two pages worth of content that you love. To make it a little easier...

- This is how I butchered my career and turned it into a [scandalously brief two page résumé](resume/danielle-navarro-academic-resume.pdf)
- This is the [R markdown file it's based on](resume/danielle-navarro-academic-resume.Rmd)
- This is the [.tex file that you'll need](resume/svm-latex-cv.tex) if you want to use the same template^[There is a delightful appropriateness to the fact that, yes, the academic template is still using LaTeX directly (god I want to make a latex joke) rather than letting pandoc do the work and hiding the horrors from you]

The point of this exercise is mostly about prioritisation: you have things you are proud of, things you *know* are major accomplishments, and things that you feel obligated to list because you "have to". Except... you don't have to anymore. The point of this first step is letting go. Plus, you can keep this version as a nice summary of your academic accomplishments *that someone will actually read*. Because no-one is going to read that 50-page horror babe. They won't. You didn't even read it yourself, did you? Yeah, didn't think so.

Okay, done? Awesome. You're doing amazing.

A little controversially, I'm gonna suggest that step 2 should be to write some prose. An industry résumé absolutely does *not* contain prose, but the purpose of this step is to try to help you cope with the shift that will have to happen in step 3. What we're going to do in step 2 is pick and choose some content from the "step 1 résumé" and rewrite it as a verbal argument for why you personally deserve to have an industry job (if it helps, try to find a specific job on linkedin or whatever that you actually want, and write for that job). Again, this is a shit way to write industry CV, but you've written grant applications before right? Lots of grant applications. You're depressingly good at writing those. We're going to repurpose that skill set. 

Here's what I came up with when I did this...

- This is the [verbose résumé itself](resume/danielle-navarro-verbose-resume.pdf)
- This is the [R markdown file it's based on](resume/danielle-navarro-verbose-resume.Rmd)

Now, anyone who has a good grasp of how industry works knows perfectly well this is no good. But it serves a purpose. Notice the difference in how I'm writing in this second version? I'm no longer dispassionately listing things, I'm making a sales pitch. You're used to thinking like this already because this is how grants work, and this version of the CV reads like a very small grant application. 

Still not an industry CV though. Folks in industry don't want to read. That's not because they don't like reading, but because industry is sooooooooo much bigger than academia. When they advertise a job they get even more CVs than we ever did in academia, and the poor person whose job it is to handle this on the other end really does like it if you make their life easier. Don't make them read if you don't have to!

At long last we get to step 3...

### ...and it you should advertise YOU



## It's speed dating, not a courtship

For junior academics, applying for positions is often a numbers game: finding that first academic appointment involves a lot of applications, a lot of rejections, and a lot of anxiety. For senior academics, however, the process is different. There's not really a "job market" in the traditional sense, just a loose network of relationships that you can use to "put out feelers" and surreptitiously negotiate a move if a mutually agreeable arrangement is possible. In many ways it is a courtship, involving many trips, back and forths, and evolves over a long time frame, and eventually culminates in a proposal of marriage (or tenured professorship). 

Prepare for some culture shock!


## Don't play fair when the deck is stacked

> You're at a disadvantage. So use whatever secret weapons you have. Shamelessly. Everyone else will be doing something similar anyway

## Negotiation?

Look, you already know the situation here. 

## Welcome to the new world, we have tiny cakes

Arrival is hard. Who are devops and what are they even for? How does anything work at this mad time scale anyway?
