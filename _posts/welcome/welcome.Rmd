<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r meta, echo=FALSE}
# import utility functions as a module
box::use(../../source/utils[
  set_meta_tags, set_redirect, set_source
])

# specify meta tags for twitter card (can differ from post summary)
set_meta_tags(
  title =  "Welcome to the jungle", 
  description = "Some thoughts on starting over, when I have tried my hand at blogging many times before"
)

# create a redirect for this post
set_redirect(params$slug)
```

<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

I've decided the time has come to restart my blog. I've tried blogging many times before with mixed success, and this time around I'd like to avoid the mistakes of the past. I've set up this blog with a few principles in mind:

- **Simplicity**. One mistake I've often made is to create blogs using the fanciest tools I could find. For example, I've previously used Hugo based packages like blogdown and hugodown, and much as I love those tools (and use them on other sites) I want this blog to be as low-maintenance as possible. To that end I'm using distill, and I'm keeping the default settings in most respects.

- **Encapsulation**. There was a time when I really liked the idea of having my blog integrated nicely with my homepage ([djnavarro.net](https://djnavarro.net)). I've become less keen on this because the aesthetic and technical demands of a blog aren't always aligned with the needs of my homepage. This time I've set it up so that the  [blog.djnavarro.net](https://blog.djnavarro.net) subdomain corresponds to a different repository from my homepage. I'm hoping this will make blogging simpler from a technical standpoint.

- **Focus**. Another mistake I have made in the past is letting blogs "sprawl", mixing personal essays with technical posts. My intention with th'is blog is to write technical posts only, mostly on R and data science. I've moved my personal writing to [essays.djnavarro.net](https://essays.djnavarro.net) and my artwork to [art.djnavarro.net](https://art.djnavarro.net). My hope is that this will make blogging easier from an emotional standpoint. 

Not sure how this will go, but fingers crossed! `r emo::ji("crossed_fingers")`
