She currently works as a Developer Relations Engineer at Voltron Data, helping other data scientists use Apache Arrow to accelerate their data analysis pipelines. In a previous life she was an academic, working as a computational cognitive scientist at UNSW Sydney. Danielle is a cofounder of R-Ladies Sydney, and in her better moments she makes art from code. She is prone to describing herself in the third person in biographies, but is willing to admit that itâ€™s super weird.\nProfile image, courtesy of Mara Averick:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
