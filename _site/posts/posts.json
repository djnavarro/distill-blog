I‚Äôve tried blogging many times before with mixed success, and this time around I‚Äôd like to avoid the mistakes of the past. I‚Äôve set up this blog with a few principles in mind:\nSimplicity. One mistake I‚Äôve often made is to create blogs using the fanciest tools I could find. For example, I‚Äôve previously used Hugo based packages like blogdown and hugodown, and much as I love those tools (and use them on other sites) I want this blog to be as low-maintenance as possible. To that end I‚Äôm using distill, and I‚Äôm keeping the default settings in most respects.\nEncapsulation. There was a time when I really liked the idea of having my blog integrated nicely with my homepage (djnavarro.net). I‚Äôve become less keen on this because the aesthetic and technical demands of a blog aren‚Äôt always aligned with the needs of my homepage. This time I‚Äôve set it up so that the blog.djnavarro.net subdomain corresponds to a different repository from my homepage. I‚Äôm hoping this will make blogging simpler from a technical standpoint.\nFocus. Another mistake I have made in the past is letting blogs ‚Äúsprawl‚Äù, mixing personal essays with technical posts. My intention with th‚Äôis blog is to write technical posts only, mostly on R and data science. I‚Äôve moved my personal writing to essays.djnavarro.net and my artwork to art.djnavarro.net. My hope is that this will make blogging easier from an emotional standpoint.\nNot sure how this will go, but fingers crossed! ü§û\n\nSource code\n\nR markdown source on GitHub\n\nLast updated\n\nMon Apr  5 16:43:32 2021\n\nR environment\n\nrenv lockfile on GitHub\n\n\nR version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10)\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)\nRunning under: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/blas/libblas.so.3.9.0\nLAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lapack/liblapack.so.3.9.0\n\nlocale:\n [1] LC_CTYPE=en_AU.UTF-8       LC_NUMERIC=C              \n [3] LC_TIME=en_AU.UTF-8        LC_COLLATE=en_AU.UTF-8    \n [5] LC_MONETARY=en_AU.UTF-8    LC_MESSAGES=en_AU.UTF-8   \n [7] LC_PAPER=en_AU.UTF-8       LC_NAME=C                 \n [9] LC_ADDRESS=C               LC_TELEPHONE=C            \n[11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_AU.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C       \n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods  \n[7] base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] Rcpp_1.0.6         knitr_1.31         magrittr_2.0.1    \n [4] downlit_0.2.1.9000 here_1.0.1         R6_2.5.0          \n [7] rlang_0.4.10       fansi_0.4.2        stringr_1.4.0     \n[10] metathis_1.0.3     tools_4.0.3        xfun_0.22         \n[13] jquerylib_0.1.3    htmltools_0.5.1.1  assertthat_0.2.1  \n[16] yaml_2.2.1         digest_0.6.27      rprojroot_2.0.2   \n[19] crayon_1.4.1       brio_1.1.1         box_1.0.0         \n[22] purrr_0.3.4        sass_0.3.1         vctrs_0.3.7       \n[25] distill_1.2        glue_1.4.2         evaluate_0.14     \n[28] rmarkdown_2.7      emo_0.0.0.9000     stringi_1.5.3     \n[31] compiler_4.0.3     bslib_0.2.4        generics_0.1.0    \n[34] lubridate_1.7.9.2  jsonlite_1.7.2     renv_0.12.3       \n\n\n\n\n",
