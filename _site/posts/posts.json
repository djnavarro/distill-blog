It’s not that I’m particularly enamoured of Apple or Microsoft, and I do enjoy the freedom to tinker that linux systems provide, but without the same resourcing that underpins Windows or Mac OS, I do spent a disproportionate amount my time trying to make my long-suffering Ubuntu laptop do something that would “just work” if I’d gone with one of the more traditional options. But such is life, and besides, there’s a case to be made that the time I spend on these things is not wasted: usually, I end up learning something useful.\nThis is one of those stories.\n\nla la la la la\n\nThe story is quite short…\nUsing GitHub credentials with R\nFor some years now I have been using git repositories for version control, with some ambivalence to my feelings. I absolutely love version control, and I think GitHub is a fabulous tool, but git itself gives me headaches. It feels counterintuitive and untidy, and I am resistant to learning new git tricks because of that. However, now that GitHub has soft-deprecated password authentication, I find myself needing to learn a new thing if I am going to continue using GitHub as my git remote. Sigh.\nLike many R users, whenever I encounter a git problem my first impulse is to see whether Happy Git and GitHub for the useR (Bryan 2018) can help me out, and true to form, it can. Having decided that I will revert to being an https girl, renouncing my flirtation with ssh, I’ve found the chapter on caching https credentials extremely useful. The usethis article on git credentials is also worth the read.\nThe problem can be broken into three parts:\nHow do I set up an authentication token on my GitHub account?\nHow do I configure my git installation to use the authentication token?\nHow do I ensure that R detects these credentials?\nThanks to the fabulous work of the tidyverse team, it’s possible for R users to solve the problem in a fairly painless way. The solution has been documented repeatedly, but for the sake of completeness I’ll repeat the advice here.\nSetting up the credentials\nWhenever I am faced with a problem in life, my first instinct is always to ask “can I do this in R?” Although it has not been very helpful in getting my laundry done, it is a mindset that has served me well in my professional life. So I’ll try to do everything within R, which is now quite easy. Step 1 is to set up a GitHub token using the usethis package (Wickham and Bryan 2021):\n\n\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\n\n\nThis will open GitHub in a browser window, take you to the “create a new token page”, and pre-populate all the fields with sensible default values. After accepting these values, the token is created and you’ll be given a PAT, a “personal authentication token”. It’ll look something like this…\nghp_dgdfasdklfjsdklfjsadfDKFJASDLKFJ3453\nYou should immediately save this in a secure password manager, like 1password, lastpass, etc, because GitHub will only show it to you this one time.\n\nYou did save it to your password manager, right?\n\nRight?\n\nYou really might need it again.\n\nYou really might.\n\nYes, you.\n\nAll right then.\n\nI’ll trust you’ve taken sensible precautions now, so let’s keep going. Step 2 in the process is to configure your git installation to use this token. This is, once again, quite easy to do with gitcreds (Csárdi 2020):\n\n\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\n\n\nUpon hitting enter, R will ask you for the PAT. Paste it into the console, hit enter and you are done. Your git installation is now configured to use the token. Yay, let’s move onto step 3, which is to ensure that R will recognise and use these credentials. As it turns out, step 3 doesn’t require you to do anything, because it happens automatically! The usethis functions like pr_init() and pr_push() recognise your credentials as soon as gitcreds sets them up and everything works perfectly…\n\nquinn\n\n… unless you’re on linux\nIf you’re on linux, you might find yourself in the same boat I was. The credentials you just set up work flawlessly for about 15 minutes, at which time R complains that it cannot find any credentials and you spend the next 15 minutes crying melodramatically.\nWhen this happened to me I assumed the problem was in my R environment. I spent a long time looking for updates to gitcreds, usethis, and every R package I could think of that might possibly be involved in communicating with git. Nothing worked. The reason nothing worked is that the problem wasn’t with R at all… it was git, and in hindsight I realise that the problem is specific to git on linux. All those beautiful people with their fancy Windows and Mac machines won’t run into the problem I encountered. They won’t spend an entire Saturday trying to git credential management, and they will never know my pain. Curse them and their superior purchasing decisions.\nJust kidding. I love my quirky little Ubuntu box and I have a lot of fun learning how to fix her up every time she sets herself on fire.\n\ndaria\n\nWhere did I leave my config?\nAlthough git makes it possible to store configuration locally, at the repository level, I rarely need this flexibility. The relevant information is stored in the global file: on my machine, this is located at /home/danielle/.gitconfig. I can ask git to list these configuration settings, like this\n\ngit config --global --list\n\nand at the start of this exercise the output would have looked like this:\nuser.name=Danielle Navarro\nuser.email=d.navarro@unsw.edu.au\nI’m not sure why this is, but I always feel slightly more reassured when I’m able to inspect the configuration file itself. Opening my .gitconfig file shows the same information, but the formatting is slightly different in the raw file:\n[user]\n    name = Danielle Navarro\n    email = d.navarro@unsw.edu.au\nTo solve the git credential problem, we’re going to need to edit this configuration information. Depending on which solution you go with, you might need to install new software too.\nDon’t forget to update git\nBefore starting, it’s a good idea to make sure you have the latest version of git, because older versions won’t have the tools you need. As it happens, I had already updated git to the most recent version (2.32.0 at the time of writing), but in case anyone ends up relying on this post, here’s how you do it:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install git\nThree solutions\n1. Set a long timeout for the git cache\nRecent versions of git are released with a credential cache that retains your credentials in memory temporarily. The information is never written to disk, and it expires after a time. You can tell git to use this cache as your “credential helper” by typing the following command at the terminal:\n\ngit config --global credential.helper cache\n\nAfter doing this, my .gitconfig file now looks like this:\n[user]\n    name = Danielle Navarro\n    email = d.navarro@unsw.edu.au\n[credential]\n    helper = cache\nUnfortunately this isn’t an ideal solution, because the cache expires after 900 seconds (15 minutes). As soon as the cache expires, git loses track of your GitHub credentials and as a consequence usethis::pr_push() suddenly stops working, and you have to set the credentials again by calling gitcred::gitcred_set() and entering the PAT again. You did store it in a password manager right? Because if not, you’re going to have to create a new one like I did about a dozen times.\nA simple solution to this problem is to ask git to store information in the cache for a little bit longer. Instead of 900 seconds, maybe ask for 10 million seconds. That way, you’ll only have to refresh the cache using gitcred::gitcred_set() once every four months instead of four times an hour. Implementing this solution requires only one line of code at the terminal:\n\ngit config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'\n\nAfter typing this, my .gitconfig file looks like this:\n[user]\n    name = Danielle Navarro\n    email = d.navarro@unsw.edu.au\n[credential]\n    helper = cache --timeout=10000000\nThis is a perfectly functional solution to the problem… “find the thing that normally happens 15 minutes and drag it out for 4 months” may not be the most elegant way to handle it, but it works.\n\ntrent\n\n2. Use libsecret credential manager\nIt puzzled me slightly that this problem only exists for linux computers, so I did a little more reading on how git manages credentials. It turns out you don’t have to rely on the in-memory cache: you can tell git to use some other program to supply the credentials. This is what all those swanky Mac and Windows people have been doing all along. On Macs, for example, git defaults to using the OS X keychain to store credentials safely on disk. It’s possible to do the same thing on linux using libsecret (source on gitlab) and it’s not much harder than the “long cache” trick described in the previous section.\nThe first step is ensuring libsecret is installed on your machine. It probably is (or at least, it was on my Ubuntu 20.04 box), but in case it isn’t here’s the command you need\n\nsudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libsecret-1-dev\n\nIt helps to realise that libsecret isn’t an application designed to work with git (i.e., it’s not the credential manager), nor is it the keyring where the passwords are stored. Rather, it’s a library that communicates with the keyring: I found this post useful for making sense of it. So if we want to use libsecret to access the keyring, we’re going to need a git credential manager that knows how to talk to libsecret. As it turns out, git comes with one already, you just have to build it using make:\n\ncd /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret\nsudo make\n\nThis will build the git-credential-libsecret application for you (stored in the same directory), and now all you have to do is tell git to use to manage your GitHub credentials:\n\ngit config --global credential.helper \\\n  /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret/git-credential-libsecret\n\nAfter typing that, my .gitconfig file looks like this:\n[user]\n    name = Danielle Navarro\n    email = d.navarro@unsw.edu.au\n[credential]\n    helper = /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret/git-credential-libsecret\nAt this point we’re ready to go. Just in case, it’s probably worth checking that R is reading the correct configuration information, which you can do with gitcreds:\n\n\ngitcreds::gitcreds_list_helpers()\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"/usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret/git-credential-libsecret\"\n\nIf everyone is talking to each other properly, the next time you call gitcreds::gitcreds_set(), R will pass your PAT to git, git will pass it to git-credential-libsecret, git-credential-libsecret will pass it to libsecret, and it will end up in your linux keychain. Whenever you need to authenticate and push some commits up to GitHub from R, it should find the credentials the same way.\n\nquinn et al\n\n3. Use GCM core\nIn the end I decided to go with “git credential manager core” GCM Core. It’s developed by Microsoft and, perhaps unsurprisingly, it is what GitHub currently recommends. It’s slightly more painful to set up, and the installation instructions are different depending on what flavour of linux you’re running. Because I’m on Ubuntu 20.04, I downloaded the .deb file associated with the most recent release of GCM core, and then installed directly using the dpkg command:\n\nsudo dpkg -i <path-to-deb-file>\n\nThis will build `git-credential-manager-core on your system, and once that’s done you can ask it to take care of the configuration for you:\n\ngit-credential-manager-core configure\n\nThis will edit the .gitconfig file, so for me it now looks like this:\n[user]\n    name = Danielle Navarro\n    email = d.navarro@unsw.edu.au\n[credential]\n    helper = \n    helper = /usr/bin/git-credential-manager-core\n[credential \"https://dev.azure.com\"]\n    useHttpPath = true\nIn a happier world you would be done at this point, but we don’t live in a happy world. We live in a sick sad world that has global pandemics and pineapple on pizzas. So there’s still one job left to do.\nMuch like the git-credential-libsecret application I compiled in the previous section, GCM core is a git credential manager: it communicates with git, but it doesn’t store the passwords itself. Instead, it provides you with several options. The first option on the list is to connect to a secret service API, which (as far as I can tell) is just a fancy way of referring to a linux keychain. That’s basically the same approach that we adopted in the libsecret approach, and as it turns out GCM core actually uses libsecret as the method for communicating with the keychain. So that’s the option I went with:\n\ngit config --global credential.credentialStore secretservice\n\nHaving done this, my .gitconfig file now looks like this:\n[user]\n    name = Danielle Navarro\n    email = d.navarro@unsw.edu.au\n[credential]\n    helper = \n    helper = /usr/bin/git-credential-manager-core\n    credentialStore = secretservice\n[credential \"https://dev.azure.com\"]\n    useHttpPath = true\nAs before, I can check that R is reading the correct configuration information…\n\n\ngitcreds::gitcreds_list_helpers()\n\n\n[1] \"/usr/bin/git-credential-manager-core\"\n\n…and now I’m ready to go.\n\nOh the sheer excitement of it all.\n\nI hope I can contain my boundless enthusiasm and joy.\n\n\ndaria\n\n\n\njane\n\n\nLast updated\n2021-08-08 18:39:07 AEST\nDetails\nsource code, session info, lockfile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBryan, Jennifer. 2018.

    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA little while ago I was invited by Sara Mortara to contribute art as part of an exhibit to be presented at the 2021 useR! conference, along with several artists who I admire greatly. I could hardly say no to that, now could I? So I sent some pieces that I’m fond of, most of which are posted somewhere on my art website. I realised later though that I was going to have to talk a little about my art too, and Sara suggested an informal Q&A during the timeslot allocated to the exhibit. Naturally, I agreed since that meant I didn’t have to prepare anything formal, and like all artists I am extremely lazy. Later though, it occurred to me that it actually wouldn’t be terrible if I wrote a blog post to accompany my contribution to the exhibit, loosely based on the questions Sara suggested. And so here we are…\nWhen did you start using R for art? Do you remember your first piece?\nI started making art in R some time in late 2019. I’d discovered some of the art that Thomas Lin Pedersen had been making – at the time he was posting pieces from his Genesis series – and at the same time I found the ambient package that he was using to create the pieces. Thomas famously does not post source code for his art, and being stubborn and curious I wanted to work out how he was doing it, so I started playing with ambient to see if I could reverse engineer his system. My very first piece was Constellations, shown below. It’s certainly not the prettiest thing I’ve created, and there are a lot of things I’d like to change about it now, but it’s nice to have your early work lying around to see how you’ve changed since then:\n\nConstellations\n\nIf you follow the link above and look at Thomas’ Genesis pieces you can tell that it’s not even remotely close to the mark, but I did eventually get the hang of it and managed to produce a few pieces like Rainbow Prisms which are closer to the kind of work he was producing:\n\nRainbow Prisms\n\nIt’s still not quite the same as Thomas’ in style, but by the time I’d worked out how to produce these I decided it was time to change my approach and branch out a bit. I love Thomas’ work of course, but I didn’t want my art to be just a low quality imitation of his! And besides, by that point I’d started discovering a whole lot of other people making generative art in R, such as Will Chase, Antonio Sánchez Chinchón, Marcus Volz, and (somewhat later) Ijeamaka Anyene. Each has their own style and – following the famous advice that art is theft – have shamelessly taken ideas and inspiration from each at different times.\nSome of those early pieces are still around, as part of the Rosemary gallery.\nWere you an artist before making generative art in R?\nNot really. I always wanted to do more artistic and creative things, but the only thing I’d ever done that required any kind of mix of aesthetic sensibility and craftwork was gardening. I used to have a lovely garden in Adelaide with a mix of Mediterranean and Australian native plants, and I had the same kind of enthusiasm for gardening then as I do for art now. Maybe one day I’ll garden again but there’s no space for that in my Sydney apartment!\nCan you talk about your creative process? Do you begin from code or from the outcome you are looking for? Do you start with the color palette in mind, or is it an iterative process?\nI’m honestly not sure I have a consistent process? I spend a lot of time browsing artwork by other people on twitter and instagram, and from time to time I read posts about the techniques that they use. Whenever I do this I end up thinking a bit about how I might use this technique or wondering what methods other artists use to create their work, but I don’t usually act on that information until I think of something I want to do with it. That kind of technical or stylistic information is like background knowledge that lies dormant until I need it.\nMost of the time the starting point for my art is an emotion. I might be angry or lonely or tired, or just in need of something to occupy my mind and distract me from something else. When I start implementing a new system it’s often (though not always) a modification of a previous one. In principle this modification process could go in any direction, but my aesthetic sensibilities depend a lot on my state of mind, and that imposes a bias. I tweak the code one way, and see what it produces. If I like it, I keep the change, if I don’t I reject it. It’s a lot like a Metropolis-Hastings sampler that way, but my mood strongly shapes the accept/reject decision, so the same starting point can lead to different outcomes. As a concrete example, the Pollen, Bursts and Embers series are all based on the same underlying engine, the fractal flame algorithm created by Scott Draves, but my emotional state was very different at the time I coded each version. For example, the Pollen Cloud piece I contributed to the useR exhibit is soft and gentle largely because I was feeling peaceful and relaxed at the time:\n\nPollen Cloud\n\nBy way of contrast, the Geometry in a Hurricane piece from Bursts is layered in jagged textures with a chaotic energy because I was angry at the time I was coding:\n\nGeometry in a Hurricane\n\nThe Soft Ember piece below (also included in the exhibit) has a different feel again. There’s more energy to it than the pollen pieces, but it’s not as chaotic as the bursts series. Again, that’s very much a reflection of my mood. I wasn’t angry when I coded this system, but I wasn’t relaxed either. At the time, something exciting had happened in my life that I wasn’t quite able to do anything about, but I was indulging in the anticipation of a new thing, and some of that emotion ended up showing through in the pieces that I made at the time:\n\nSoft Ember\n\nTo bring all this back to the question, it’s very much an iterative process. The driver behind the process is usually an emotion, and the colour choices, the shapes, and the code are all adapted on the fly to meet with how I’m feeling.\nWhat is your inspiration?\nTo the extent that my art is driven by emotion, the inspiration for it tends to be tied to sources of strong emotion in my life. Sometimes that emotion comes from the sources of love and joy: family, intimate partners, and so on. The Heartbleed series is one of those. The background texture to these images is generated by simulating a simple Turing machine known as a turmite and the swirly hearts in the foreground are generated using the toolkit provided by the ambient package. This system is very much motivated from emotional responses to the loved ones in my life. One of the pieces in the exhibit is from this series:\n\nTurmite 59 in Red\n\nOther times the emotional motivation comes from sources of pain - sometimes things that were physically painful, sometimes that were psychologically painful. The Orchid Thorn piece I included in the exhibit is one of those, linked to an intense physically painful experience.\n\nOrchid Thorn\n\nThe Bitterness piece below, which I haven’t done much with other than post to my instagram, is strongly tied to the psychological stresses associated with my gender transition. Yes, there’s a softness to the piece, but there’s also a sandpaper-like texture there that makes me think of abrasion. The colour shifts make me think about transitions, but the roughness at some of the boundaries reminds me that change is often painful.\n\nBitterness\n\nOne odd property of the art, at least from my point of view, is that looking at a given piece recalls to mind the events and emotions that inspired the work, and to some extent that recollection becomes a way of re-experiencing the events. Sometimes that’s a good thing. Not always though.\nWhat is your advice for people who wants to create art in R?\nI think I’d suggest three things. Find artists you like, read about their processes. Sometimes they’ll show source code or link to algorithms like I’ve done in a few places in this piece, and it can be really valuable to try to retrace their steps. There’s nothing wrong with learning technique by initially copying other artists and then developing your own style as you go.\nThe second thing I’d suggest, for R folks specifically, is to take advantage of the skills you already have. Most of us have skills in simulation, data wrangling, and data visualisation, and those skills can be repurposed for artistic work quite easily. A lot of my pieces are created using that specific combination. I’ll often define a stochastic process and sample data from it using tools in base R, use dplyr to transform and manipulate it, then use ggplot2 to map the data structure onto a visualisation. One of the nice things about dplyr and ggplot2 being compositional grammars is the fact that you can “reuse” their parts for different purposes. I get a lot of artistic mileage out of geom_point() and geom_polygon(), and quite frankly purrr is an absolute godsend when the generative process you’re working with is iterative in nature.\nThe other thing would be try not to put pressure on yourself to be good at it immediately. I wasn’t, and I don’t think anyone else was either. Earlier I showed the Constellations piece and referred to it as the first piece I created. In a way that’s true, because it was the first time I reached a level that I felt comfortable showing to other people. But I made a lot of junk before that, and I made a lot of junk after that. I make some good art now (or so people tell me) precisely because I made a lot of bad art before. Even now, though, I can’t tell which systems will end up good and which will end up bad. It’s a bit of a lottery, and I’m trying my best not to worry too much about how the lottery works. I like to have fun playing with visual tools, and sometimes the tinkering takes me interesting places.\nAnything to add about your pieces in the exhibit?\nNot a lot. Several of the pieces I’ve contributed are already linked above, but I might just say a little about the other pieces and how they were made. The Silhouette in Teal piece uses the flametree generative art package to create the tree shown in silhouette in the foreground, and a simple random walk to generate the texture in the background:\n\nSilhouette in Teal\n\nIt has also been surprisingly popular on my Society6 store, which you can visit if you want some of my art on random objects. I am not sure why, but I have sold a lot more shower curtains and yoga mats than I would have expected to sell in my lifetime.\nLeviathan emerged from my first attempt to create simulated watercolours in R using this guide written by Tyler Hobbs. I was in a dark mood at the time and the ominous mood to the piece seems quite fitting to me.\n\nLeviathan\n\nThe Floral Effect piece is an odd one. It’s part of the Viewports series that I created by applying Thomas Lin Pedersen’s ggfx package over the top of the output of the same system I used to create the Native Flora series, which in turn is an application of the flametree system I mentioned earlier. I quite like it when these systems build on top of one another.\n\nFloral Effect\n\nThe last piece I included, Fire and Ice, is a little different from the others in that it’s not a “pure” generative system. It works by reading an image file into R, using Chris Marcum’s halftoner package to convert it to a halftone image, and then manipulate that image using the tools provided in the ambient package. The end result is something that still resembles the original image but has more of a painted feel:\n\nFire and Ice\n\n\nLast updated\n2021-07-08 12:59:55 AEST\nDetails\nsource code, session info, lockfile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For example, in a recent project I wanted to be able to create something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting R markdown\n\nAn introduction to R markdown. The target audience is a novice R user with no previous experience with markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting ggplot2\n\nAn introduction to ggplot2. The target audience is a novice user with no previous experience with R or ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting programming\n\nThis is primarily a tutorial on making generative art in R, but in doing so introduces core programming constructs and data structures.\n\n\n\n\nIt bothered me that this wasn’t as straightforward as I was expecting, so for one of my side projects I’ve been putting together a small package called bs4cards to make this a little easier inside an R markdown document or website. There’s an introductory vignette posted on the bs4cards package website showing how the package works, and there’s no need to duplicate that content here. However, because this website uses the distill package (Allaire et al. 2021) and the package website is built using pkgdown (Wickham, Hesselberth, and Salmon 2021), it seems like a good idea to have at least one post on both sites that uses bs4cards.\nEnabling bootstrap 4\nThe reason for doing this is that the first step in using the package is to make sure that your R markdown document uses version 4 of bootstrap: the bs4cards package takes its name from the cards system introduced in bootstrap version 4, and will not work properly if used in R markdown documents that rely on bootstrap version 3, or don’t use bootstrap at all. To ensure that you are using bootstrap 4, you need to edit the YAML header for your document to specify which version of bootstrap you want to use. The instructions are slightly different depending on what kind of document you’re creating:\nVanilla R markdown\nFor a plain R markdown document or website (i.e., one where the output format is html_document) here is the relevant section of YAML you might use:\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    theme:\n      version: 4\nThis overrides the R markdown defaults (Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer 2020) to ensure that the output is built using bootstrap 4.5.\nPkgdown\nTo enable bootstrap 4 in a pkgdown site, the process is similar but not identical. Edit the _pkgdown.yml file to include the following\ntemplate:\n  bootstrap: 4\nNote that this relies on a currently-in-development feature, so you may need to update to the development version of pkgdown to make this work.\nDistill\nDistill R markdown does not natively use bootstrap, but you can enable it by including the relevant information through the header. This is a two step process. First, create a file called header_bs4.html or something. The content of the file should be as follows:\n<!-- bootstrap 4, for non-distill content -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\" integrity=\"sha384-B0vP5xmATw1+K9KRQjQERJvTumQW0nPEzvF6L/Z6nronJ3oUOFUFpCjEUQouq2+l\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\n<script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-DfXdz2htPH0lsSSs5nCTpuj/zy4C+OGpamoFVy38MVBnE+IbbVYUew+OrCXaRkfj\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-Piv4xVNRyMGpqkS2by6br4gNJ7DXjqk09RmUpJ8jgGtD7zP9yug3goQfGII0yAns\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script>\nThen you need to add the following lines to your YAML header:\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    includes:\n      in_header: header_bs4.html\nIf, like me, you only want to enable bootstrap 4 for a specific post, this goes in the YAML header for that post only, and the header_bs4.html file goes in the same folder as the .Rmd file for your post. Alternatively, if you want to enable bootstrap 4 for the entire site, this markup goes in the _site.yml file, and the header_bs4.html file goes in the same folder as _site.yml.\nOnce that’s done you should be ready to go!1\nTesting with kittens\nJust to make certain, let’s check that it does what we want by generating a random card using kitten images and lorem ipsum placeholder text:\n\n\nbs4cards::sample_card()\n\n\n\n\nA kitten card\nHaec para/doca illi, nos admirabilia dicamus.

The song is called Secrets, taken from the fabulous Thirteen Tales of Love and Revenge album by The Pierces\nAnytime you write R code whose output needs to be understood by a human being, it is an act of kindness to spend a little time making sure that the output shown to the human being properly communicates with that human. As a consequence of this, you often find yourself needing to write information to the R console, just to cater to those precious human sensibilities. Perhaps the simplest way to do this is to use the cat() function. It’s a simple tool and it gets the job done in most cases.\nFor example, consider the use case for the antagonist character “A” from Pretty Little Liars, whose stalking and threats were delivered mostly via text message. Had she used R to craft her threatening text messages, she could have written code like this:\n\n\nwait <- function(seconds = 2) {\n  Sys.sleep(seconds)\n}\n\nsend_cat_threat <- function() {\n  cat(\"Dead girls walking.\\n\"); wait()\n  cat(\"--A.\\n\")\n}\n\n\n\nEquipped with a function that specifies her threat, complete with a dramatic pause for effect, she’s ready to go. When her unwitting victim does something to trigger the send_cat_threat() function, a two part message is displayed on the console. The first part shows up immediately\n\nDead girls walking.\n\nand after a two second delay, her call sign is revealed\n\nDead girls walking.\n--A.\n\nIt’s not too difficult to imagine what this message might look like at the R console, but where’s the fun in that? Thanks to the asciicast package (Csárdi et al. 2019), there’s no need to leave anything to the imagination, and we can see the malevolent message in screencast form:\n\n\n\n\nThe ominous text messages used in this post are taken from Pretty Little Liars. This one is from episode two in season one. It’s important that one documents ones sources, right?\nUsing cat() to craft messages works perfectly well for simple text communication, but sometimes you want something that looks a little fancier. After all, if the big picture plan here is to impersonate a dead teenager and terrorise her friends - and for some reason you’ve chosen R to do so - you might as well put a little effort into the details, right?\nMeet the cli package\nOne thing I love about the R community is that if you search long enough you’ll find that someone else has already written a package that solves the problem you’re facing. If your problem is “how to craft nicely formatted messages” then you’ll be delighted to learn that many wonderful things become possible if you have the cli package (Csárdi 2021a) as your talented assistant. To craft a beautiful command line interface (CLI) of her very own, the first thing A will need to do is load the package:\n\n\nlibrary(cli)\n\n\n\nOnce this is done, it is a very trivial task for A to write the same threatening text message using cli_text()…\n\n\nsend_cli_threat <- function() {\n  cli_text(\"Dead girls walking.\"); wait()\n  cli_text(\"--A.\")\n}\nsend_cli_threat()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…which is nice and all, but it doesn’t make much of a case for using cli. Stalking and threatening is busy work, and I’d imagine that A would want a more compelling justification before deciding to switch her evil workflow. However - much like A herself - the R console has many dark secrets, and fancier tricks than this are possible once you know how to expose them using cli.\nUsing the status bar\nOne piece of magic that I have wondered about for a long time is how fancy progress bars work: often when you’re doing something that takes a long time, you’ll see an ASCII progress bar rendered in text on the screen, which suddenly vanishes once the process is complete. How exactly does this work? Normally you can’t “unprint” a message from the console, so how is it possible for the progress bar to update without leaving an ugly trail of earlier messages behind it?\nWhile teaching myself cli, I found the answer. The most recent line of text generated at the terminal is speciall. It’s called the status bar: the state of the status bar can be manipulated, and the cli package provides a neat toolkit for doing so. So let’s say I were trying to convince A to switch to the cli tools. Right now, she’s writing a function that will send a four-part message, using cli_text() because I’ve at least convinced her to try the new tools:\n\n\nmessage_scroll <- function() {\n  cli_text(\"You found my bracelet.\"); wait()\n  cli_text(\"Now come find me.\"); wait()\n  cli_text(\"Good luck bitches.\"); wait()\n  cli_text(\"-A\"); wait()\n}\nmessage_scroll()\n\n\n\nWhen her victim triggers this message the lines will appear on screen, one after the other with an appropriate dramatic pause separating them. The victim might see something that looks like this:\n\n\n\nThe problem – when viewed from an evil point of view – is that this message stays on screen after delivery.1 The victim has time to think about it, take a screenshot to show her friends, that kind of thing. Wouldn’t the gaslighting be so much more effective if she were to send the message piece by piece, each part disappearing as the next one appears, only to have the whole thing vanish without a trace and leaving the victim wondering if she imagined the whole thing? This is where the status bar comes in handy. Here’s how it would work:\n\n\nmessage_inline <- function() {\n  id <- cli_status(\"\")\n  cli_status_update(id, \"You found my bracelet.\"); wait()\n  cli_status_update(id, \"Now come find me.\"); wait()\n  cli_status_update(id, \"Good luck bitches.\"); wait()\n  cli_status_update(id, \"-A\"); wait()\n  cli_status_clear(id)\n}\n\n\n\nThe first line in this function uses cli_status() to create a blank message on the status bar, and returns an identifier that refers to the status bar. The next four lines all use cli_status_update() to overwrite the current state of the status bar, and then pause dramatically for two seconds. In a final act of malice, the last line in the function clears the status bar using cli_status_clear(), leaving nothing except a blank space behind. So what the victim sees is something more like this:\n\n\nmessage_inline()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message was sent to Aria in episode 10 of season one. I’m sure it is deeply important to everyone that I mention this.\nCreating spinners\nThe ability to control the status bar opens up a world of new possibilities. Progress bars are one such possibility, but the progress package (Csárdi and FitzJohn 2019) already does this nicely, and in any case I suspect that A might be more intrigued by the possibility of spinners, since they just spin and spin and give the victim no clue about when the process is going to end. Much more appealing when the developer doesn’t know (or doesn’t want to reveal) when the wait will end. The cli package has a nice makes_spinner function that serves this purpose. Here’s an example:\n\n\nspinny <- make_spinner(\n  which = \"dots2\",\n  template = \"{spin} It's not over until I say it is.\"\n)\n\n\n\nThe which argument is used to choose how the spinner would look, and the template argument is used to define how the “spinny bit” is placed relative to the rest of the text. The spinny object includes functions to update the state of the spinner (in this case spinny$spin() would be that function), and a function to clear the spinner from the status bar. So here’s how A might define a function that uses a spinner to keep the victim in suspense…\n\n\ntheatrics <- function(which) {\n  \n  # define the spinner\n  spinny <- make_spinner(\n    which = which,\n    template = \"{spin} It's not over until I say it is.\"\n  )\n  \n  # update the spinner 100 times\n  for(i in 1:100) {\n    spinny$spin()\n    wait(.05)\n  }\n  \n  # clear the spinner from the status bar\n  spinny$finish()\n  \n  # send the final part of the message\n  cli_alert_success(\"Sleep tight while you still can, bitches. -A\")\n}\n\n\n\nHere’s what happens:\n\n\ntheatrics(\"dots2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message was sent to all four of the liars in the final episode of season one. I don’t think A used a spinner though, which feels like a missed opportunity to me\nSetting which = \"dots2\" is only one possibility. There are quite a lot of different spinner types that come bundled with the cli package, and I’d imagine A would want to look around to see which one suits her needs. Personally, I’m a fan of hearts:\n\n\ntheatrics(\"hearts\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see the full list use the list_spinners() function:\n\n\nlist_spinners()\n\n\n [1] \"dots\"                \"dots2\"               \"dots3\"              \n [4] \"dots4\"               \"dots5\"               \"dots6\"              \n [7] \"dots7\"               \"dots8\"               \"dots9\"              \n[10] \"dots10\"              \"dots11\"              \"dots12\"             \n[13] \"line\"                \"line2\"               \"pipe\"               \n[16] \"simpleDots\"          \"simpleDotsScrolling\" \"star\"               \n[19] \"star2\"               \"flip\"                \"hamburger\"          \n[22] \"growVertical\"        \"growHorizontal\"      \"balloon\"            \n[25] \"balloon2\"            \"noise\"               \"bounce\"             \n[28] \"boxBounce\"           \"boxBounce2\"          \"triangle\"           \n[31] \"arc\"                 \"circle\"              \"squareCorners\"      \n[34] \"circleQuarters\"      \"circleHalves\"        \"squish\"             \n[37] \"toggle\"              \"toggle2\"             \"toggle3\"            \n[40] \"toggle4\"             \"toggle5\"             \"toggle6\"            \n[43] \"toggle7\"             \"toggle8\"             \"toggle9\"            \n[46] \"toggle10\"            \"toggle11\"            \"toggle12\"           \n[49] \"toggle13\"            \"arrow\"               \"arrow2\"             \n[52] \"arrow3\"              \"bouncingBar\"         \"bouncingBall\"       \n[55] \"smiley\"              \"monkey\"              \"hearts\"             \n[58] \"clock\"               \"earth\"               \"moon\"               \n[61] \"runner\"              \"pong\"                \"shark\"              \n[64] \"dqpb\"               \n\nShowing cli messages in R markdown\nThroughout this post I’ve relied on asciicast to display screencasts of the R console as animated SVG files, rather than what I might normally do and rely on regular R markdown code chunks to do the work. There’s a reason for this: the R console is a terminal, and its behaviour doesn’t always translate nicely to HTML. Part of the magic of the rmarkdown package (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018) is that most of the time it is able to capture terminal output and translate it seamlessly into HTML, and we mere mortal users never notice how clever this is. However, when dealing with cli output, we run into cases where this breaks down and the law of leaky abstractions comes into play: text generated at the R console does not follow the same rules as text inserted into an HTML document, and R Markdown sometimes needs a little help when transforming one to the other.\nAn important thing to remember about cli is that the text it produces is a message, so its visibility in R Markdown depends on the chunk option for messages. As long as the message option is set to TRUE, R Markdown will include them as part of the output.2 In the simplest case, R Markdown works nicely, so as long as all A wants to do is send an unformatted threat within an R Markdown document, then this works:\n\n\ncli_text(\"I'm still here bitches, and I know everything. -A\")\n\n\nI'm still here bitches, and I know everything. -A\n\nHowever, the moment A tries to use any fancy formatting, things will go haywire for her. For example, suppose she wanted to send the message above as a simple “alert” message using cli_alert(), which uses fancy symbols and colours in the output. It is at this point that the cracks in the R Markdown pipeline start to leak. In this case, the leak would result in the document failing to knit and an error message complaining about\nPCDATA invalid Char value\nIntuitively she might guess that somewhere in the R Markdown pipeline, an invalid or malformed character has been created.3 The reason this happens is that the colours and symbols used by cli, and supported in the R console, rely on ANSI escape codes, but those escape codes aren’t recognised in HTML and – apparently – they can wreak havoc when R markdown writes those characters into the HTML document. ANSI colours in R are usually generated with the help of the crayon package (Csárdi 2021b), and per the issue #24 thread that I encounter on a semi-regular basis, it can be tricky to manage the process of translating these to HTML via R Markdown.\nSolving this issue requires A to jump through a few hoops. It’s annoying I know, but no-one ever said that running an unhinged stalking campaign via text messages was easy, right? Her first task is to make sure that the R Markdown document turns on crayon support:\n\n\noptions(crayon.enabled = TRUE)\n\n\n\nThis isn’t the whole solution, however, because while that tells R Markdown to stop ignoring all the ANSI stuff, it doesn’t necessarily allow it to render ANSI sequences properly. To fix this she needs to specify the knit hooks that explicitly tell R Markdown what to do. She can do this with the help of the fansi package (Gaslam 2021), which contains an obscurely-named function sgr_to_html() that translates a subset of the ANSI control sequences to HTML, and strips out all the others. Using this, she can write an ansi_aware_handler() function that will take an input string x and return HTML output appropriate for the R Markdown context:\n\n\nansi_aware_handler <- function(x, options) {\n  paste0(\n    \"<pre class=\\\"r-output\\\"><code>\",\n    fansi::sgr_to_html(x = x, warn = FALSE, term.cap = \"256\"),\n    \"<\/code><\/pre>\"\n  )\n}\n\n\n\nFrom there, it’s relatively easy. All she needs to do is tell knitr (Xie 2021) to use this function whenever it needs to handle output. Just for good measure she might do the same for messages, errors, and warnings:\n\n\nknitr::knit_hooks$set(\n  output = ansi_aware_handler, \n  message = ansi_aware_handler, \n  warning = ansi_aware_handler,\n  error = ansi_aware_handler\n)\n\n\n\nAt long last she is done.4 Her campaign of bullying and cruelty can continue:\n\n\ncli_alert(\"I'm still here bitches, and I know everything. -A\")\n\n\n→ I'm still here bitches, and I know everything. -A\n\n\n\nThis message was sent in the pilot episode. Yes, the quotes I’ve used are all from season one: I’ve just started a rewatch of the show, so the early episodes are quite fresh in my memory!\nWriting longer messages\nUp to this point the threatening messages that A has been sending have been short, only one line long. In several cases the messages have been cleverly constructed so that the same line (the status bar) is used to display multiple pieces of text, but ultimately it’s still one line messaging. A needs to take a little care when she wants to branch out. Conceptually, a message should correspond to “one semantically meaningful bundle of information” that might be split over several lines. However, as far as R is concerned, each call to cli_text() creates a distinct message. To see how this might cause A some grief, here’s the letter that she sent to Aria’s mother announcing the infidelity of Aria’s father:\n\n\nsend_cruel_letter_piecewise <- function() {\n  cli_text('Your husband, Byron, is involved with another woman')\n  cli_text('and when I say involved I mean in a \"romantic\" way.')\n  cli_text('This is not something recent. It started before your')\n  cli_text('family went away to Iceland and from the look of')\n  cli_text('things, it may be starting up again now that you\\'re')\n  cli_text('back. I know this is hard to hear, but it is the')\n  cli_text('truth. If you don\\'t believe this about your husband,')\n  cli_text('ask your daughter. She knows all about it.')\n  cli_text('Sincerely,')\n  cli_text('A')\n}\n\nsend_cruel_letter_piecewise()\n\n\nYour husband, Byron, is involved with another woman\n\nand when I say involved I mean in a \"romantic\" way.\n\nThis is not something recent. It started before your\n\nfamily went away to Iceland and from the look of\n\nthings, it may be starting up again now that you're\n\nback. I know this is hard to hear, but it is the\n\ntruth. If you don't believe this about your husband,\n\nask your daughter. She knows all about it.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA\n\n\nThis is not an ideal implementation. What A wants to send is one message spanning 10 lines not 10 separate one-line messages, but it’s the latter that she has actually implemented here. This is where the cli() function is handy: to takes an expression as input and collects all the constituent parts into a single message. This version of the function now sends a single message:\n\n\nsend_cruel_letter_singly <- function() {\n  cli({\n    cli_text('Your husband, Byron, is involved with another woman')\n    cli_text('and when I say involved I mean in a \"romantic\" way.')\n    cli_text('This is not something recent. It started before your')\n    cli_text('family went away to Iceland and from the look of')\n    cli_text('things, it may be starting up again now that you\\'re')\n    cli_text('back. I know this is hard to hear, but it is the')\n    cli_text('truth. If you don\\'t believe this about your husband,')\n    cli_text('ask your daughter. She knows all about it.')\n    cli_text('Sincerely,')\n    cli_text('A')\n  })\n}\n\nsend_cruel_letter_singly()\n\n\nYour husband, Byron, is involved with another woman\nand when I say involved I mean in a \"romantic\" way.\nThis is not something recent. It started before your\nfamily went away to Iceland and from the look of\nthings, it may be starting up again now that you're\nback. I know this is hard to hear, but it is the\ntruth. If you don't believe this about your husband,\nask your daughter. She knows all about it.\nSincerely,\nA\n\n\n\nThe letter was sent to Ella in episode four season one. Even on a rewatch I’m finding it impossible to imagine Holly Marie Combs as anyone other than Piper from Charmed and I keep expecting “Ella” to stop time and, idk, shave off her husbands eyebrows or something?\nMuch nicer. As every would-be tormenter knows, it’s important to pay attention to the details.\nCreating structured messages\nWriting long messages when sending a threatening letter is a simple enough thing, but at some point A will likely find herself wanting to add some structure to these missives. Lists are nice. Stalkers like keeping lists, I hear. With that in mind, a nice property of cli is that it allows you to separate style from structure using an HTML-like syntax. Top level headings are specified using cli_h1(), and second level headings are produced by cli_h2(). Unordered lists are produced using cli_ul() and ordered lists by cli_ol(). This make it easy to write structured messages to the R console:\n\n\ncli({\n  cli_h1(\"Characters\")\n  cli_h2(\"The Liars\")\n  cli_ul(c(\n    \"Alison DiLaurentis\",\n    \"Spencer Hastings\",\n    \"Aria Montgomery\",\n    \"Hanna Marin\",\n    \"Emily Fields\"\n  ))\n  cli_h2(\"The A-Team\")\n  cli_ul(c(\n    \"Mona Vanderwaal\",\n    \"Lucas Gottesman\",\n    \"Melissa Hastings\"\n  ))\n})\n\n\n\n── Characters ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n── The Liars ──\n\n● Alison DiLaurentis\n● Spencer Hastings\n● Aria Montgomery\n● Hanna Marin\n● Emily Fields\n\n── The A-Team ──\n\n● Mona Vanderwaal\n● Lucas Gottesman\n● Melissa Hastings\n\n\nBetter yet, the cli package has a whole swathe of other utilities that follow this same HTML-like naming scheme, making it possible to send elaborate and disturbing messages in so many different ways.\nEpilogue\nThere is a lot more to the cli package that I haven’t talked about in this post. I’ve not talked about how to modify the themes, how to create custom cli “apps” that use different themes or send output to different connections. I’ve not talked about how to use conditional logic within a cli call, displaying different messages depending on whether a process succeeds or fails. Those will have to remain secret for now, because this post is quite long enough already and quite frankly I’m still learning myself. Besides, these powers would no doubt would be put to terrible purposes in an R-themed Pretty Little Liars spinoff show, and I’m not entirely sure that all secrets need sharing…\n\n\ncli(\n  cli_blockquote(\n    quote = \"Friends share secrets, that's what keeps us close\",\n    citation = \"Alison\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n    “Friends share secrets, that's what keeps us close”\n    — Alison\n\n\n\nLast updated\n2021-04-18 21:49:23 AEST\nDetails\nsource code, session info, lockfile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCsárdi, Gábor. 2021a.

If it were the R console it would stay on screen the whole time.↩︎\nSomewhat counterintuitively, although cli emits messages that can be suppressed by suppressMessages(), they don’t behave precisely the same as the messages produced by message(). The default handler for base R messages sends the output to the stderr() connection and so they are often shown as the dreaded “red text” that users learn to fear. To avoid this, the default behaviour in cli sends messages to the stdout() connection, thereby avoiding this issue. However, cli does allow you to control this behaviour: see the start_app() and stop_app() functions for more information.↩︎\nAs an aside, if you’re running a site with an RSS feed it may also write malformed characters into the index.xml file as well as any generated .html file. When I encountered this problem I found that even when I “fixed” my .Rmd file the document wouldn’t re-knit, because of the problems with the xml file. Eventually I realised that I could solve the problem by deleting the index.xml file for the RSS feed and then knitting again. Sigh↩︎\nNote that there is also the fansi::set_knit_hooks() function which will set the hooks in a more user-friendly way. I don’t think there’s any reason not to use it: the only reason I didn’t is that I found it convenient to write things from scratch here so that I understood what was happening.↩︎\n",

I’ve tried blogging many times before with mixed success, and this time around I’d like to avoid the mistakes of the past. I’ve set up this blog with a few principles in mind:\nSimplicity. One mistake I’ve often made is to create blogs using the fanciest tools I could find. For example, I’ve previously used Hugo based packages like blogdown and hugodown, and much as I love those tools (and use them on other sites) I want this blog to be as low-maintenance as possible. To that end I’m using distill for R markdown, and I’m keeping the default settings in most respects.\nEncapsulation. There was a time when I really liked the idea of having my blog integrated nicely with my homepage (djnavarro.net). I’ve become less keen on this because the aesthetic and technical demands of a blog aren’t always aligned with the needs of my homepage. This time I’ve set it up so that the blog.djnavarro.net subdomain corresponds to a different repository from my homepage. I’m hoping this will make blogging simpler from a technical standpoint.\nFocus. Another mistake I have made in the past is letting blogs “sprawl”, mixing personal essays with technical posts. My intention with this blog is to write technical posts only, mostly on R and data science. I’ve moved my personal writing to essays.djnavarro.net and my artwork to art.djnavarro.net. My hope is that this will make blogging easier from an emotional standpoint.\nReproducibility. A frustration I’ve had with my previous blogs is that my posts were not particularly reproducible. Source code was often missing, information about the R session was not provided, and so on. This time, I’ve set up the blog so that there is a “details” section at the bottom of each post containing links to the source code, the R session information, and a lockfile generated using renv::snapshot().\nAt this stage I’m not entirely certain how I’ll use the blog. There are a lot of possibilities, and I have some thoughts on which ones I’d like to explore. A self-contained blog such as this seems nicely suited to teaching materials. An obvious example would be to write blog posts to accompany the data science slides and youtube videos I’ve been making. The lack of written material to go with those talks has bothered me for some time. Another possibility might be to write tutorials on generative art. I use my art website to post the art itself, but the site functions as a gallery rather than a classroom. I get a lot of people asking questions about how I make my art, and this blog might be a good place to provide answers. Those aren’t the only possibilities, of course, but they are appealing ones.\nNot sure how this will go, but fingers crossed! 🤞\n\nLast updated\n2021-04-06 13:19:30 AEST\nDetails\nsource code, session info, lockfile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
