I‚Äôve tried blogging many times before with mixed success, and this time around I‚Äôd like to avoid the mistakes of the past. I‚Äôve set up this blog with a few principles in mind:\nSimplicity. One mistake I‚Äôve often made is to create blogs using the fanciest tools I could find. For example, I‚Äôve previously used Hugo based packages like blogdown and hugodown, and much as I love those tools (and use them on other sites) I want this blog to be as low-maintenance as possible. To that end I‚Äôm using distill, and I‚Äôm keeping the default settings in most respects.\nEncapsulation. There was a time when I really liked the idea of having my blog integrated nicely with my homepage (djnavarro.net). I‚Äôve become less keen on this because the aesthetic and technical demands of a blog aren‚Äôt always aligned with the needs of my homepage. This time I‚Äôve set it up so that the blog.djnavarro.net subdomain corresponds to a different repository from my homepage. I‚Äôm hoping this will make blogging simpler from a technical standpoint.\nFocus. Another mistake I have made in the past is letting blogs ‚Äúsprawl‚Äù, mixing personal essays with technical posts. My intention with this blog is to write technical posts only, mostly on R and data science. I‚Äôve moved my personal writing to essays.djnavarro.net and my artwork to art.djnavarro.net. My hope is that this will make blogging easier from an emotional standpoint.\nReproducibility. A frustration I‚Äôve had with my previous blogs is that my posts were not particularly reproducible. Source code was often missing, information about the R session was nor provided, and so on. This time, I‚Äôve set up the blog so that there is a ‚Äúdetails‚Äù section at the bottom of each post containing links to the source code, the R session information, and a lockfile generated using renv::snapshot().\nNot sure how this will go, but fingers crossed! ü§û\n\nLast updated\n2021-04-05 19:52:34 AEST\nDetails\nsource code, session info, lockfile\n\n\n\n",
